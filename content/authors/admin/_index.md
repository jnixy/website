I am a Professor in the [School of Criminology and Criminal Justice](https://www.unomaha.edu/college-of-public-affairs-and-community-service/criminology-and-criminal-justice/) at the University of Nebraska at Omaha. I coordinate our MA program and teach undergraduate and graduate-level classes on policing and research methods. I'm also a Co-Director of the [VIPR Lab](https://viprlab.org). My research centers on policing with emphases on procedural justice, legitimacy, and police shootings (view [my CV](https://jnix.netlify.app/files/cv.pdf)).
