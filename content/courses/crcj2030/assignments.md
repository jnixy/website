## Assignment 1: Identifying the Best Path Forward

An [article](https://doi.org/10.1111/1745-9133.12572) published in *Criminology & Public Policy* last month polled a national sample of 1,137 Americans about their support for “popular slogans and their substantive policy goals.” I have uploaded the article to the “files” folder in Canvas.

Your first assignment of the semester is to **read the article and write a 500 word reflection essay**. In it, you should do the following:

1.	Identify the key finding. In other words, what’s the big-picture takeaway from this article? 
2.	Identify which policy you are most supportive of and explain why. You should also explain why you’re less supportive of the other policies.
3.	Explain how likely (or unlikely) you believe it is that we can achieve said policy in the foreseeable future. 

Your essay should be uploaded to Canvas no later than **10AM next Tuesday (2/8/22)**. If you want, you can write your essay in Word (or whatever you normally use), then cut/paste it into Canvas when you’re finished. 

**Do not plagiarize**. Please note that your submissions will be reviewed by Turnitin, a plagiarism review software. If you’re unsure about what constitutes plagiarism, please consult with me before you submit your essay. 

## Assignment 2: Reading Quiz

Assignment #2 is a reading quiz I've posted to our course page on Canvas. It has ten multiple-choice questions drawn from the material we've covered in Chapters 5 and 6. It should be completed by **5PM on Sunday, March 20th**.
