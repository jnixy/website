summary: The primary goal of this undergraduate course is to facilitate students' growth as both consumers and producers of research. We will explore a variety of methodologies (e.g., survey research/self-report, official stats/secondary data, quasi-experimental design, etc.) used in criminological and criminal justice research. Further, we will evaluate these methodologies within the context of design concerns such as: research purpose, operationalization, validity, reliability, and ethics.
