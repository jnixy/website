In this course, we will explore the function of the police in American society - all the while considering the challenges associated with balancing civil liberties on the one hand with the goal of controlling crime on the other. I will push you to think critically about the scientific methods used to answer various research questions, as well as reflect on policing's contributions to the larger CJ system and society, more generally.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, you will be able to:
- Analyze the evolution of the police function in American society from the 1960s to present
- Evaluate research evidence on police strategies and their effectiveness using rigorous methodological standards
- Apply legal and ethical frameworks to police decision-making and use of force
- Synthesize multiple perspectives on police culture, legitimacy, and reform
- Critically assess contemporary debates about the proper role and scope of policing

## Required Readings

We'll read a mixture of seminal articles by police researchers and more contemporary work by a variety of interdisciplinary experts working in this area. I expect you to read critically and come prepared to discuss how the material relates to contemporary policing and society. Most of the required readings are available on Canvas and/or linked whenever possible on the [Course Schedule](https://jnix.netlify.app/courses/crcj8040/course_schedule/) page. The three assigned books are all available for fairly cheap as paperbacks or eBooks. You may also be able to borrow/request them from the [campus library](https://www.unomaha.edu/criss-library/index.php) or [Omaha Public Library](https://omahalibrary.org/).

## Journals

Each week at the end of class, I'll ask you to take approximately 10 minutes to reflect on a question or issue and write your thoughts down in a "journal." Then as you do the readings for the following week on your own time, you'll update your journal. *Do you still feel the same way? Why or why not? Did the readings change your mind or make you to think about the issue in a different way? What questions do you still have?* At the beginning of the next class, we'll break the ice by discussing what you wrote in your journals. 

### Journal Guidelines

- **Initial reflection** (end of class): ~250 words responding to the prompt
- **Updated reflection** (after completing readings): ~250 words on how your thinking evolved
- Focus on the **evolution of your thinking**, not summary of readings
- Graded on **depth of reflection**, not “right” answers
- Submit via Canvas by Monday 11:59 p.m. before each class
- Late submissions accepted up to 48 hours with 10% penalty

## Exams

There will be two in-class exams this semester: **a midterm on March 10th and a final on April 28th**. For each exam, you will choose one of three essay questions, using class time to respond to it. You may bring one page (front and back) of handwritten notes to each exam.

## Attendance & Participation

This is a seminar course—your presence and engagement matter. You may miss **one class without penalty**. Additional absences will affect your grade unless documented (illness, family emergency, etc.).

Participation means:

- Coming prepared (readings completed, journal updated)
- Contributing to discussion (quality over quantity)
- Listening actively and engaging respectfully with diverse perspectives
- Participating in activities (simulations, debates, group work)

## Grades 

* Attendance and participation: 25%
* Journal: 25%
* Midterm: 25%
* Final: 25%

These weighted scores will be added up at the end of the semester to generate your overall grade in the course:

Letter Grade  |  Score
------------- | -------
A             | 90 - 100
B             | 80 - 89
C             | 70 - 79
D             | 60 - 69
F             | 0 - 59

## Technology in Class

- Laptops/tablets are welcome for taking notes and accessing readings
- Please avoid non-class use (email, social media, etc.)
- Phones should be silenced and put away during class

## Academic Integrity

*Don't cheat.* Students should familiarize themselves with the University of Nebraska at Omaha's Statement of Student Rights and Responsibilities and the [policy on academic integrity](https://www.unomaha.edu/student-life/student-conduct-and-community-standards/policies/academic-integrity.php). Any form of academic dishonesty is unacceptable. Instances of academic dishonesty will, at a minimum, result in a failing grade for that assignment, and a record of academic dishonesty will be placed in the student's academic file that is maintained by the School of Criminology and Criminal Justice. Instances of academic dishonesty may also be subject to disciplinary action by the University.

**Please note**: The use of generative AI tools (such as ChatGPT or others) is strictly prohibited and constitutes
a violation of academic integrity in this course.
