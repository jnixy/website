In this course, we will explore the function of the police in American society – all the while considering the challenges associated with balancing civil liberties on the one hand with the goal of controlling crime on the other. I will push you to think critically about the scientific methods used to answer various research questions, as well as reflect on policing’s contributions to the larger CJ system and society, more generally.

## Required Readings

I expect you to read critically and come prepared to discuss how the material relates to contemporary policing and society. All required readings are available on Canvas (or linked whenever possible on the [Course Schedule](https://jnix.netlify.app/courses/crcj8040/course_schedule/) page).

## Journals

Each week at the end of class, I’ll ask you to take approximately 10 minutes to reflect on a question or issue and write your thoughts down in a “journal.” Then as you do the readings for the following week on your own time, you’ll update your journal. *Do you still feel the same way? Why or why not? Did the readings change your mind or make you to think about the issue in a different way? What questions do you still have?* At the begining of the next class, we’ll break the ice by discussing what you wrote in your journals.

## Exams

There will be two in-class exams this semester: **a midterm on October 5th and a final on December 14th**. For each exam, you will choose one of three essay questions, using class time to respond to it.

## Grades 

* Attendance and participation: 25%
* Journal: 25%
* Midterm: 25%
* Final: 25%

These weighted scores will be added up at the end of the semester to generate your overall grade in the course:

Letter Grade  |  Score
------------- | -------
A             | 90 - 100
B             | 80 - 89
C             | 70 - 79
D             | 60 - 69
F             | 0 - 59

## Academic Integrity

*Don’t cheat.* Students should familiarize themselves with the University of Nebraska at Omaha’s Statement of Student Rights and Responsibilities and the [policy on academic integrity](https://www.unomaha.edu/student-life/student-conduct-and-community-standards/policies/academic-integrity.php). Any form of academic dishonesty is unacceptable. Instances of academic dishonesty will, at a minimum, result in a failing grade for that assignment, and a record of academic dishonesty will be placed in the student’s academic file that is maintained by the School of Criminology and Criminal Justice. Instances of academic dishonesty may also be subject to disciplinary action by the University.
