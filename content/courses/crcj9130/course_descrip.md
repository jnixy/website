## Course Description

This course covers a variety of topics that are fundamental to understanding American policing in the 21st Century. Many have been proposed as reforms that could help fix systemic problems in American policing. We will read a few “classic” studies, but the bulk of the material will be comprised of cutting edge research that has been published in the last decade or so. Each week, we will welcome a guest speaker with expertise on the topic.
