## Course Description

This course covers a variety of topics that are fundamental to understanding American policing in the 21st Century. Many have been proposed as reforms that could help fix systemic problems in American policing. We will read a few “classic” studies, but the bulk of the material will be comprised of cutting edge research that has been published in the last decade or so. Each week, we will welcome a guest speaker with expertise on the topic.

## Required Readings

I expect you to read critically and come prepared to discuss how the material relates to contemporary policing and society. All of the required readings are available on Canvas.

## Reaction Papers

Each week, you’ll be required to submit a written “review” of each reading. In other words, imagine you’ve been invited by the journal’s editor to review the paper. Summarize its major strengths and weaknesses, and comment on what you believe are its “big picture” takeaways. These should be approximately 1-2 single-spaced pages in length and will collectively account for 25% of your grade.

## Research Proposal and Presentation

Each student will write a research proposal and give a presentation to the class based upon its content. The written proposal should be 10 – 15 pages (double-spaced) and the research presentation should be 10 – 15 minutes (or 20 including Q&A). The written proposal is due no later than **April 20th**, and research presentations will take place in class the same day. We will discuss this assignment in more detail later in the semester. Topics must be approved by me, and should be submitted in writing (approx. one page) no later than **March 2nd**.

## Grades 

* Attendance and participation: 30%
* Reaction papers: 25%
* Research proposal: 25%
* Research presentation: 20%

These weighted scores will be added up at the end of the semester to generate your overall grade in the course:

Letter Grade  |  Score
------------- | -------
A             | 90 - 100
B             | 80 - 89
C             | 70 - 79
D             | 60 - 69
F             | 0 - 59

## Academic Integrity

*Don’t cheat.* Students should familiarize themselves with the University of Nebraska at Omaha’s Statement of Student Rights and Responsibilities and the [policy on academic integrity](https://www.unomaha.edu/student-life/student-conduct-and-community-standards/policies/academic-integrity.php). Any form of academic dishonesty is unacceptable. Instances of academic dishonesty will, at a minimum, result in a failing grade for that assignment, and a record of academic dishonesty will be placed in the student’s academic file that is maintained by the School of Criminology and Criminal Justice. Instances of academic dishonesty may also be subject to disciplinary action by the University.
