## Research Proposal and Presentation

Each student will write a research proposal and give a presentation to the class based upon its content. The written proposal should be 10 – 15 pages (double-spaced) and the research presentation should be 10 – 15 minutes (or 20 including Q&A). The written proposal is due no later than **April 20th**, and research presentations will take place in class the same day. We will discuss this assignment in more detail later in the semester. Topics must be approved by me, and should be submitted in writing (approx. one page) no later than **March 2nd**.
