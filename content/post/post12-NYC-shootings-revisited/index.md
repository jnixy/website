title: "NYC Shootings, Revisited"

In my [last post](https://jnix.netlify.app/post/post11-nyc-covid-shootings/), I pointed out that shootings weren't occurring less frequently in NYC in 2020 than in prior years, despite the COVID-19 pandemic. I was also careful not to jump to the conclusion that shootings had increased significantly.

That was June 3rd. Suffice it to say a lot has happened since then - including **624 additional shootings.** Each of the last four years, NYC had fewer than 200 shootings from June to July. This year, they had **449**. As of August 26th, there have been 965 shootings this year, which is a year-to-date increase of **88 percent**. In fact, NYC *finished* each of the last *three years* with fewer than 800 shootings by my count. 

Here's the (rolling) average daily number of shootings, dating back to January 1, 2016:

These alarming figures have led some, myself included, to [wonder](https://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/ny-oped-the-end-of-crime-decline-20200719-e77s74cv7nhxjllosarp74lp2u-story.html) whether NYC is approaching the end of its decades-long crime decline. 

I sure hope it's just a blip and not the start of a new trend.
