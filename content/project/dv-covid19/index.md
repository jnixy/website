## Summary

[Study after study](https://covid19.counciloncj.org/2021/01/31/impact-report-covid-19-and-crime-3/) has shown that help-seeking for domestic violence increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. My colleague, [Tara Richards](https://twitter.com/Prof_TNR), was quick to observe that all of the research to date has relied on official data (e.g., calls for police service, reported crimes). Research has yet to consider whether victim service agency hotlines experienced an uptick in calls during COVID-19.

So, we started collecting official data from several jurisdictions from the [Police Data Initiative](https://www.policedatainitiative.org/datasets/), and reaching out to victim service agencies in the same jurisdictions to request the daily number of calls they'd received from 2018 to 2020. 

We've collected data from the following jurisdictions:

- Baltimore
- Cincinnati
- Hartford
- Montgomery Co.
- New Orleans
- Orlando
- Phoenix
- Sacramento
- Salt Lake City
- Seattle
- St. Petersburg

## Site Briefs

We prepared a short, "plain English" brief for each jurisdiction that was kind enough to share their data with us. Those are linked at the top of the page.
