## Summary

Ongoing work with my colleague Tara Richards, as well as Scott Mourtgos and Ian Adams, on help-seeking for domestic violence during the COVID-19 pandemic. We leverage calls for police service data as well as calls to victim service agency hotlines in several U.S. cities.

## Publications

* Nix, J., & Richards, T. N. (2021). The immediate and long-term effects of COVID-19 stay-at-home orders on domestic violence calls for service across six US jurisdictions. [*Police Practice and Research*](https://doi.org/10.1080/15614263.2021.1883018).

## Presentations

* **UN Women**: The impact of COVID-19 on responses to domestic violence (Thursday, March 25, 2021 at 10AM CST). *Slides will be posted soon!*

## Site Briefs

We prepared a short, "plain English" brief for each jurisdiction that was kind enough to share their data with us. Those are linked at the top of the page.
