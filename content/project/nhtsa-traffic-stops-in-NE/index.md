## Abstract

In Nebraska, concerns about racial disparities in traffic enforcement demand serious attention from police executives. Fortunately, other states like [Connecticut](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1745-9133.12528) have developed model practices that have been successfully adopted elsewhere, including Rhode Island, Oregon, and California. We propose to implement the Connecticut Model in Nebraska by creating an Advisory Board, securing and analyzing data compiled by the Nebraska Commission on Law Enforcement and Criminal Justice (NCC) with multiple “benchmark tests,” and developing and rolling out strategies to mitigate uncovered disparities (e.g., training sessions, model policies).
