abstract: Focusing on Mexican cartels and affiliated drug trafficking organizations,
  this article examines how self-proclaimed cartel members use social media to further
  the criminal activities of their organizations. Employing an opensource, intelligence-driven
  methodology, the authors identified, followed, and mapped the connections between
  and among 75 alleged cartel members over a period of 4 months. Results indicated
  that cartel members actively use Facebook to plan, organize, and communicate in
  real-time. These findings provide tentative validation to the utility of using open-source
  social media platforms to study the social structure and operations of Mexican drug
  cartels. Implications for law enforcement, homeland security, and the intelligence
  enterprise are discussed.
