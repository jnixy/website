abstract: We examined whether police officer self-legitimacy moderates the effect
  of supervisor procedural injustice on organizational trust. Data from a sample of
  sheriff’s deputies (N = 510) were used to test this question. Results from multivariate   models
  showed that (a) supervisor procedural injustice was associated with less organizational
  trust among deputies, (b) self-legitimacy was positively associated with trust in
  the agency, and (c) self-legitimacy conditioned the effect of procedural injustice
  on organizational trust. These findings advance the literature in several ways.
  First, this study provides one of the first empirical examinations of organizational
  trust—a concept widely studied in the business-related literature—in a police agency
  context. The findings suggested that supervisor procedural injustice and officer
  self-legitimacy are key correlates of trust in a police agency. Second, the results
  further underscore the importance of self-legitimacy by revealing that it can serve
  as a protective factor against negative experiences within the organization.
