abstract: Tyler’s process-based model of policing suggests that the police can enhance
  their perceived legitimacy and trustworthiness in the eyes of the public when they
  exercise their authority in a procedurally fair manner. To date, most process-based
  research has focused on the sources of legitimacy while largely overlooking trust
  in the police. The present study extends this line of literature by examining the
  sources of trust in the police. In particular, emerging research has revealed that
  neighborhood context influences attitudes toward the police but much less attention
  has been given to exploring the role individuals’ perceptions of their neighborhood
  play in shaping such evaluations. Therefore, the present study considers whether
  individuals’ perceptions of collective efficacy serve as a social-psychological
  cognitive orientation that influences levels of trust in the police. Using data
  from a recently conducted mail survey of a random sample of 1,681 residents from
  a metropolitan city, we find that procedural justice evaluations are a primary source
  of trust in the police. At the same time, however, level of perceived collective
  efficacy is positively associated with trust even after accounting for procedural
  justice. The findings suggest that police procedural fairness is vitally important
  to establishing trust from the public but peoples’ cognitive orientation toward
  their neighborhood context partially shapes the level of trustworthiness they afford
  to the police.
