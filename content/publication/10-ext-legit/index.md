abstract: Until recently, police legitimacy research has primarily focused on citizen
  perceptions of the police. However, it may be that the police believe citizens associate
  other factors, such as distributive justice or performance, with legitimacy. The
  present study adds to the literature by surveying a nationally representative sample
  of U.S. police officers about how they believe citizens residing in high and low
  crime areas of the community evaluate police in terms of legitimacy. Findings suggest
  that respondents believe procedural justice and distributive justice are important
  to citizens of both areas in terms of generating trust. At the same time, respondents
  believe that citizens of high and low crime areas feel obligated to obey the police
  for different reasons.
