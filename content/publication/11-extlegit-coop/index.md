abstract: Tyler’s process-based model of regulation suggests that when citizens perceive
  the police as a legitimate authority, they are more likely to cooperate in the form
  of reporting crimes and providing information to the police. Yet most studies have
  considered citizens’ perceptions of police legitimacy— few studies have asked the
  police what they feel makes them legitimate in the eyes of the public. Likewise,
  no studies have considered whether the police believe legitimacy is associated with
  cooperation from the public. The present study addresses this gap using data from
  a stratified sample of U.S. police executives. Findings suggest police believe performance,
  rather than procedural justice, is the key to generating cooperation from the public.
