abstract: ' _Objectives_: Policing in the United States has come under intense scrutiny
  following numerous deadly force incidents involving unarmed black citizens, which
  dominated the news media. Some have argued that consequently, a “chill wind” has
  blown through law enforcement, such that officers have become more distrustful of
  civilians, fearful of scandal, and are de-policing. To date, however, scholars have
  given insufficient theoretical and empirical attention to why and how media coverage
  of policing may lead to such outcomes. _Methods_: We addressed this literature gap
  using data from a survey of officers in a metropolitan police department in the
  southeast. _Results_: We found that officers perceive that media coverage of policing
  has a large effect on civilians, so much so as to impact crime rates. In turn, hostile
  media perceptions increase officers'' 1) likelihood of believing that civilians''
  attitudes and behaviors toward police have worsened in recent years—that is, that
  there is a legitimacy crisis—and 2) fear of having false allegations lodged against
  them. Additionally, hostile media perceptions indirectly increase officers'' likelihood
  of believing that crime is rising in their city, by increasing their perceptions
  of a police legitimacy crisis and fear of false allegations. _Conclusions_: These
  findings have important implications for police-community relations moving forward.'
