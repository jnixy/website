abstract: President Obama’s Task Force on 21st Century Policing recently endorsed
  procedural justice as a way to restore trust between police and communities. Yet
  police–citizen interactions vary immensely, and research has yet to give sufficient
  consideration to the factors that might affect the importance officers place on
  exercising procedural justice during interactions. Building on research examining
  “moral worthiness” judgments and racial stereotyping among police officers, we conducted
  two randomized experiments to test whether suspect race and demeanor affect officers’
  perceptions of the threat of violence and importance of exercising procedural justice
  while interacting with suspicious persons. We find that suspect race fails to exert
  a statistically significant effect on either outcome. However, demeanor does—such
  that officers perceive a greater threat of violence and indicate it is less important
  to exercise procedural justice with disrespectful suspects. These findings have
  implications for procedural justice training, specifically, and police–community
  relations more broadly.
