abstract: Policing has been the subject of intense public scrutiny for the better
  part of two years after several high-profile police killings of unarmed African
  Americans across the United States. The scrutiny has been so extreme that some contend
  there is currently a “war on cops”—whereby citizens are emboldened by protests and
  negative media coverage of the police, and are lashing out by assaulting police
  officers more frequently. In response, it is argued that officers are de-policing
  (i.e. avoiding proactive stops). We surveyed commandlevel police officers from a
  southeastern state about their attitudes concerning the war on cops and de-policing.
  The majority of our sample believed there has been a war on cops over the last two
  years. Moreover, officers who felt strongly about the existence of a war on cops
  were more likely to believe that de-policing is common among officers in today’s
  world of law enforcement.
