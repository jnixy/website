abstract: This study examines whether the number of citizens fatally shot by police
  in the United States has changed significantly since the shooting of Michael Brown
  in Ferguson, Missouri. Using longitudinal data compiled by killedbypolice.net, we
  use an interrupted time-series design to test the effect of events in Ferguson on
  fatal shootings by police. Our analyses reveal that the number of citizens killed
  by police is temporally unstable, exhibiting random short-term fluctuations that
  are often misinterpreted as evidence of substantively meaningful trends. However,
  after testing a variety of model specifications, we find no evidence that the number
  of fatal police shootings either increased or decreased post-Ferguson. Claims to
  the contrary are based on weak analyses of short-term trends.
