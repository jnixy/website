abstract: 'Domestic disturbances are often touted as one of the most dangerous incidents
  to which police officers respond. Nevertheless, research examining the relative
  dangerousness of these incidents to responding officers is mixed. Recently, media
  outlets have compiled rich data on fatal police shootings, which provides the opportunity
  to examine police responses to domestic disturbances in a different light. Using
  data compiled by The Washington Post, this study explored whether domestic disturbances
  that resulted in a fatal shooting were more likely than other fatal shooting incidents
  to have involved: (a) a civilian armed with a firearm or toy/replica firearm or
  (b) a civilian who posed an imminent threat to officer or public safety. Findings
  suggest that there were some, albeit not many, differences in these outcomes between
  domestic disturbances and seven other incident types. Avenues for future research
  in this area are provided, along with a discussion about the availability of current
  data on this topic.'
