abstract: Recent policing research has identified a positive relationship between
  line-level officers’ perceptions of organizational justice and their adherence to
  agency goals and job satisfaction. However, we have little understanding of the
  factors that are related to police managers’ support for organizational justice
  when interacting with employees. We collected survey data from a sample of U.S.
  command-level officers (N = 211) who attended a training program in a southern state
  to address this gap in the literature. The anonymous survey was administered in-person
  to participating command-level police officers prior to their training program.
  Our multivariate regression analysis revealed that police managers who reported
  higher levels of self-control were more supportive of organizational justice (b
  = .26, p < .01). Additionally, police managers who reported higher quality relationships
  with their colleagues expressed greater support for organizational justice (b =
  .02, p = .02). Respondents’ self-legitimacy was not significantly associated with
  their support for organizational justice. This study contributes to the organizational
  justice literature by presenting the first analysis that links police commanders’
  self-control to support for organizational justice within their management practices.
  The findings help pinpoint the types of individuals who may be best equipped to
  be fair police managers.
