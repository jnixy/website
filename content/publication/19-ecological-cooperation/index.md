abstract: Neighborhood structural conditions influence police behavior, but few studies
  have addressed whether neighborhood conditions are associated with officers’ _perceptions_
  of residents in those communities. This is an important gap because officers’ perceptions
  of what they can expect from residents in disadvantaged communities may help explain
  differential treatment. Using data from the Project on Policing Neighborhoods, we
  examined neighborhood effects on officers’ perceptions of citizen cooperation. Officers
  working in beats with more concentrated disadvantage and higher homicide rates were
  less likely to believe that citizens would be willing to cooperate with law enforcement.
  We discuss this finding in relation to explaining differential police treatment
  across communities and what it means for the legitimacy dialogue that unfolds between
  the police and community.

  generally as less cooperative.
