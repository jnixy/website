abstract: Procedural justice theory increasingly guides policing reforms in the United
  States and abroad. Yet the primary sources of perceived police procedural justice
  are still unclear. Building on social schema research, we posit civilians’ perceptions
  of police procedural justice only partly reflect their personal and vicarious experiences
  with officers. We theorize perceptions of the police are anchored in a broader ‘‘relational
  justice schema,’’ composed of views about how respectful, fair, and unbiased most
  people are in their dealings with others. Individuals’ experiences with certain
  nonlegal actors and neighborhood environments should directly affect their relational
  justice schema and indirectly affect their evaluation of police. Nevertheless, experiences
  with police, especially mistreatment by officers, should also affect perceived police
  procedural justice and may moderate the effects of relational justice schema endorsement.
  We test our hypotheses in two studies with national samples. The findings strongly
  support a social schematic model of perceived police procedural justice.
