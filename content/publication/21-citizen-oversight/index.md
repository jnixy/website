abstract: ' _Purpose_ – The purpose of this paper is to explore the antecedents of
  sheriff deputies’ perceived legitimacy of their agency’s citizen advisory council
  (CAC). _Design/methodology/approach_ – The authors obtained survey data from 567
  sheriff deputies in a southeastern state. The authors first asked whether respondents
  knew their agency had a CAC, and then asked those who responded affirmatively a
  series of questions about the legitimacy of the council. The authors then ran an
  ordinary least squares regression that included organizational justice, self-legitimacy
  and public scrutiny as independent variables predicting perceived legitimacy of
  the CAC. _Findings_ – Deputies who perceived greater organizational justice from
  command staff were significantly more likely to perceive the CAC as legitimate.
  _Originality/value_ – In response to strained police/community relations, reform
  advocates have urged the police to embrace a more democratic style of policing,
  including allowing for more citizen oversight of agencies. The study sheds light
  on how line-level officers perceive such oversight.'
