abstract: 'In recent years, policing scholars have increasingly used survey methods
  to gain insight into officers' attitudes and behaviours. Yet, surprisingly, methodological
  research analysing surveys of police officers is rare. We analysed the extent and
  correlates of response rates in police surveys, providing insights about the survey
  design features and study characteristics associated with higher rates of officer
  participation. We examined the response rates to 497 police surveys reported in
  390 articles published in 15 journals from 2008 to 2017. Findings included the following:
  (1) the average response rate was 64%, but there was a great deal of variation,
  (2) in-person surveys achieved substantially higher response rates, (3) inviting
  a greater number of officers to participate in surveys was associated with lower
  response rates, and (4) response rates have declined over time (though primarily
  among surveys not administered in-person). Given the weight of the evidence suggesting
  response rates are typically a poor predictor of nonresponse bias, we argue that
  a low response rate on its own is an insufficient reason to dismiss a study's merit.
  Furthermore, we recommend minimally acceptable reporting standards and discuss avenues
  for future research.'
