abstract: Racial disparities in officer-involved shootings have dominated the national
  discourse recently. Unfortunately, we have yet to identify an appropriate benchmark,
  or at-risk population, to put these observed racial disparities into context. In
  this article, we use seven benchmarks - based on population data from the US Census,
  police-citizen interaction data from the Police-Public Contact Survey, and arrest
  data from the Uniform Crime Report - to compare OIS fatality rates for black and white
  citizens from 2015 to 2017. Using population, police-citizen interactions, or total
  arrests as a benchmark, we observe that black citizens appear more likely than white
  citizens to be fatally shot by police officers in both years. Using violent crime
  arrests or weapons offense arrests, we observe that black citizens appear less likely
  to be fatally shot by police officers. We discuss why population data is a fundamentally
  flawed benchmark, and elaborate the strengths and weaknesses of using police-citizen
  interaction or arrest benchmarks.
