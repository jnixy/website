abstract: ' __BACKGROUND__: The deadliest mass shooting in modern United States history
  occurred on October 1, 2017, in Las Vegas, killing 58 and overwhelming hospitals
  with more than 600 injured. The scope of the tragedy offers insight into medical
  demands, which may help guide preparedness for future mass shooting incidents. __METHODS__:
  Retrospective, deidentified, health care institution–provided data from all hospitals
  and blood banks providing care to Las Vegas shooting victims were gathered. Study
  authors independently reviewed all data and cross-referenced it for verification.
  Main outcomes and measures include the number of victims requiring hospital and
  intensive care admission, the amount and types of blood components transfused during
  the first 24 hours, and the amount of blood donated to local blood banks following
  the Las Vegas mass shooting. __RESULTS__: Two hundred twenty patients required hospital
  admission, 68 of them to critical care. Nearly 500 blood components were transfused
  during the first 24 hours in a red blood cell–to–plasma–to–platelet ratio of 1:0.54:0.81.
  Public citizens donated almost 800 units of blood immediately after the shooting;
  greater than 17% of this donated blood went unused. __CONCLUSIONS__: The amount
  of blood components transfused per patient admitted was similar in magnitude to
  other mass casualty events, and available blood supply met patient demand. The public
  call for blood donors was not necessary to meet immediate demand and led to resource
  waste. Preparation for future mass shooting incidents should include training the
  community in hemorrhage control, encouraging routine blood donation, and avoiding
  public calls for blood donation unless approved by local blood suppliers.'
