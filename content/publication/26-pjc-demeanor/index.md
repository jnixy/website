abstract: ' _Purpose_ – The purpose of this paper is to revisit classic theoretical
  arguments regarding the broad effects of civilian demeanor on policing and extends
  associated findings. _Design/methodology/approach_ – The theoretical framework draws
  on insights fromthe literatures on police culture, the group engagement model and
  fairness heuristic theory. The authors argue that demeanor is best conceptualized
  as the degree of procedural justice exhibited by civilians toward police. Theoretically,
  procedurally just cooperation should influence officers’ adherence to police culture
  by affecting their social identification and assessments of civilians’ motives and
  moral deservingness. To test the hypotheses, the authors surveyed sworn officers
  from a large metropolitan police department in the southeastern USA in the Fall
  of 2016. _Findings_ – Results reveal that officers use their procedural justice
  judgments as heuristics to assess civilians’ trustworthiness, dangerousness, and
  moral deservingness, and these judgments influence their policing style. Officers
  who perceive greater procedurally just cooperation by civilians feel less threatened
  by the public, are more willing to use procedural justice themselves, and are less
  supportive of a “tough cop” policing style. _Originality/value_ – The authors propose
  that: civilian demeanor is best conceptualized as the extent to which civilians
  exhibit procedural fairness toward the police; and in order for meaningful police
  reform to occur, it is important to acknowledge the role of civilian demeanor in
  shaping officers’ attitudes, beliefs and behaviors.'
