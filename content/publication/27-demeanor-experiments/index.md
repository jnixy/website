abstract: ' _Objectives_: Police legitimacy can hinge on what happens in police-civilian
  encounters, yet much remains unknown about the socio-psychological processes involved
  in these bilateral interactions, especially those affecting officers. We integrate
  insights from policing research with theories and findings from scholarship on moral
  psychology, interpersonal strain, and victimization fear to develop hypotheses about
  the situational effects of civilian demeanor on officers’ cognitions (suspicion
  and perceived danger) and emotions (anger, frustration, annoyance, and fear). _Methods_:
  We administered a series of three randomized vignettes involving routine police-civilian
  encounters to 546 officers working in a large city in the southwestern United States.
  We randomized civilian behavior—compliant, bad attitude (compliant but disrespectful),
  or noncompliant—and the encounter type—offense-based versus dispatch initiated.
  _Results_: Demeanor exerts a large causal effect on what officers think and feel
  in police-civilian encounters. In each experiment, civilian hostility and disrespect
  increased officers’ self-reported suspicion, perceived danger, and antagonistic
  emotions (anger, frustration, and annoyance). In some cases, it also increased their
  fear. _Conclusions_: Each of these cognitions and emotions may separately influence
  police decision-making, and each carries unique policy implications. Our results
  also suggest the efficacy of experimental surveys to unpack the dynamics of police-civilian
  interactions.'
