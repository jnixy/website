abstract: ' _Objectives_: This study tests the generality of Tyler’s process-based
  model of policing by examining whether the effect of procedural justice and competing
  variables (i.e., distributive justice and police effectiveness) on police legitimacy
  evaluations operate in the same manner across individual and situational differences.
  _Methods_: Data from a random sample of mail survey respondents are used to test
  the ‘‘invariance thesis’’ (N = 1681). Multiplicative interaction effects between
  the key antecedents of legitimacy (measured separately for obligation to obey and
  trust in the police) and various demographic categories, prior experiences, and
  perceived neighborhood conditions are estimated in a series of multivariate regression
  equations. _Results_: The effect of procedural justice on police legitimacy is largely
  invariant. However, regression and marginal results show that procedural justice
  has a larger effect on trust in law enforcement among people with prior victimization
  experience compared to their counterparts. Additionally, the distributive justice
  effect on trust in the police is more pronounced for people who have greater fear
  of crime and perceive higher levels of disorder in their neighborhood. _Conclusion_:
  The results suggest that Tyler’s process-based model is a ‘‘general’’ theory of
  individual police legitimacy evaluations. The police can enhance their legitimacy
  by ensuring procedural fairness during citizen interactions. The role of procedural
  justice also appears to be particularly important when the police interact with
  crime victims.'
