# Abstract
abstract = "**Research Summary**: Using open-source data from the Gun Violence Archive (GVA), we analyze national- and state-level trends in fatal and non-fatal firearm assaults of U.S. police officers from 2014 to 2019 (N = 1,467). Results show (1) the majority of firearm assaults are non-fatal, (2) there is no compelling evidence that the national rate of firearm assault on police has substantially increased over the last six years, and (3) there is substantial state-level variation in rates of firearm assault on police officers."
