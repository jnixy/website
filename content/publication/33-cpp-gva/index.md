abstract: "**Research Summary**: Using open-source data from the Gun Violence Archive (GVA), we analyze national- and statelevel trends in fatal and non-fatal firearm assaults of U.S. police officers from 2014 to 2019 (N = 1,467). Results show (1) the majority of firearm assaults are non-fatal, (2) there is no compelling evidence that the national rate of firearm assault on police has substantially increased over the last six years, and (3) there is substantial state-level variation in rates of firearm assault on police officers.

**Policy Implications**: GVA has decided strengths relative to existing data sources on police victimization and danger in policing. We consider the promises and pitfalls of this and other open-source datasets in policing research and recommend that recent state-level improvements in use-of-force data collection be replicated and expanded to include data on violence against police."
