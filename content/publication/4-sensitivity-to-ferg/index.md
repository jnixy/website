abstract: ' _Purpose_:We argue that the police have been adversely impacted by Ferguson-related
  negative publicity in ways beyond the supposed increase in crime (e.g., reduced
  motivation and increased perception of danger). Further, we suggest that organizational
  justice is a key factor that influences officers'' sensitivity to such Ferguson
  Effects. _Methods_: We used a sample of 510 sheriff''s deputies surveyed 6 months
  after the incident in Ferguson. We explored whether organizational justice is associated
  with deputies'' sensitivity to several manifestations of the Ferguson Effect using
  OLS and ordered logistic regression models. _Results_: The results demonstrated
  that deputies who believed their supervisors were more organizationally fair were
  less likely to feel unmotivated, perceive more danger, believe their colleagues
  have been negatively impacted, or feel that US citizens and local residents have
  become more cynical toward the police in the post-Ferguson era. _Conclusions_: Police
  supervisorswho use organizational justice as a guiding managerial philosophy aremore
  likely to shield their officers from the negative work-related outcomes that can
  follow recent Ferguson-type publicity. Supervisors should be fair, objective, honest,
  and respectful when dealing with their subordinates in order to communicate that
  the agency has their back even when it may appear the community does not.'
