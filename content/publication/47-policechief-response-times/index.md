# Abstract
abstract = "Using SLCPD as an example, Deputy Chief Mourtgos analyzed daily computer-aided dispatch (CAD) data from January 2016 through December 2021. The goal of the analysis was to accurately assess to what degree variation in staffing levels influences response times to CFS. Systematically assessing response times in a data-driven manner is essential to providing political stakeholders with tangible estimates of possible gains in response times based on specific changes in staffing levels."
