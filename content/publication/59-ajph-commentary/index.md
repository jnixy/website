AJPH invited me to write this editorial to accompany Julie Ward and team's latest article: [*National Burden of Injury and Deaths from Shootings by Police in the United States, 2015-2020*](https://doi.org/10.2105/AJPH.2023.307560). 

I was very pleased to see Ward et al.'s article get published - I've been [harping](https://jnix.netlify.app/post/post2-fatality-rates/) on the [importance](https://jnix.netlify.app/post/post17-another-post-about-ois-data/) of including [nonfatal shootings](https://jnix.netlify.app/post/post23-are-ois-increasing/) in analyses [like these](https://jnix.netlify.app/files/asa19_slides.pdf) for [years](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0259024) (and I'm certainly not the [first](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07418828800089691) to do so).
