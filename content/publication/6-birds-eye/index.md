abstract: ' __Research Summary__: We analyzed 990 police fatal shootings using data
  compiled by TheWashington Post in 2015. After first providing a basic descriptive
  analysis of these shootings, we then examined the data for evidence of implicit
  bias by using multivariate regression models that predict two indicators of threat
  perception failure: (1) whether the civilian was not attacking the officer(s) or
  other civilians just before being fatally shot and (2) whether the civilian was
  unarmed when fatally shot. The results indicated civilians from “other” minority
  groups were significantly more likely than Whites to have not been attacking the
  officer(s) or other civilians and that Black civilians were more than twice as likely
  as White civilians to have been unarmed. __Policy Implications__: We implore the
  U.S. government to move forward with its publication of a national police use-of-force
  database, including as much information about the officers involved as possible.We
  further suggest police departments use training programs and community activities
  to minimize implicit bias among their officers.'
