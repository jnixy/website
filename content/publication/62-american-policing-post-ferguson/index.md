I was invited to write this essay for *Fordham Urban Law Journal* back in 2016. It was published in 2017. Recently, when I was pulling together my materials for promotion, I realized the [URL was broken](https://news.law.fordham.edu/fulj/2017/08/13/policing-in-america-american-policing-in-the-post-ferguson-era/). It looks like they're in the process of digitizing their entire archive, but while you can find issues going all the way [back to the 1970s](https://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/ulj/all_issues.html), my essay is nowhere to be found. Odd. But whatever, I'm posting it here. :man_shrugging:
