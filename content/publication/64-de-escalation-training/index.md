# Abstract
abstract = "Evaluations of police de-escalation training programs have provided mixed results on the effectiveness of these programs in reducing the use of force. These programs rely on a causal logic model that suggests training improves intermediary behaviors, such as communication tactics or empathy, which decrease the likelihood of force being necessary in interactions with citizens. In this paper, we present the results of a randomized-controlled trial of a police de-escalation training curriculum. We employ systematic social observation of body-worn camera footage to examine these intermediary behaviors and analyze administrative use of force records to assess use of force as an outcome. The analyses demonstrate that the program is successful in improving intermediary behaviors but does not reduce use of force incidents. Considering these results in combination with the growing body of literature on police de-escalation training programs, we suggest that de-escalation training programs are largely successful in improving intermediary behaviors but that those behaviors are not as closely linked to use of force rates as theorized. Accordingly, we suggest that scholars and policymakers consider de-escalation training as a method for improving interpersonal skills for police officers but look for other methods to reduce the use of force."
