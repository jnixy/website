# Abstract
abstract = "**Objectives**: This manuscript tests whether artificial intelligence (AI) review of body-worn camera footage replicates the findings of a randomized-controlled trial of police de-escalation training using systematic social observation (SSO). **Methods**: Body-worn camera video that was previously analyzed using SSO was subjected to review by an AI program. The study then replicates the analysis of the randomized-controlled trial using outcomes generated by AI. The results are compared to those of the original study. **Results**: Several measures produced by the AI software modestly correlate with the SSO data and the analysis of treatment effects is replicated. **Conclusions**: AI holds considerable promise for policing researchers attempting to understand nuanced interactions. SSO has long been the gold-standard for understanding this nuance but is weakened by the time-consuming and expensive nature of the method. AI provides a promising avenue for conducting similar analyses more quickly and efficiently."
