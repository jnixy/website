# Abstract
abstract = "Using data from the Minnesota sexual assault kit initiative (MN SAKI) project, we examined the predictors of victim notifications, processes, and the outcomes. Findings indicated cases selected for victim notification (n = 80; 19.8%) were more likely to involve victims who were non-White and not cooperative; suspects who were strangers, adults, and nonWhite; and SAKs with DNA evidence, but not CODIS hits. While most victims were located and notified (n = 69; 86.2%), few re-engaged (n = 8; 10%) and case rarely resulted in prosecution (n = 2) or conviction (n = 1). Findings help build the evidence base regarding victim notification protocols. Downstream impacts of notification protocols on SAKI projects’ goals and victims’ needs and expectations are discussed."
