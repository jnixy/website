abstract: High-profile events involving police use of force in various cities throughout
  the US and internationally have garnered enormous media coverage and demonstrated
  the importance of police-community relations. To date little empirical attention
  has focused on how such events may negatively impact police officers. Using survey
  data from 567 officers, this study considers whether perceptions of negative publicity
  are adversely related to officers’ sense of self-legitimacy (i.e. the confidence
  they have in their authority). Findings revealed officers who felt less motivated
  as a result of negative publicity expressed less self-legitimacy. However, the degree
  to which officers felt their job had become more dangerous as a result of negative
  publicity was not significantly related to self-legitimacy. These findings increase
  our understanding of the sources of self-legitimacy and reveal that negative publicity
  surrounding law enforcement presents a unique challenge to officers’ confidence
  in their authority, which can have important implications for the community.
