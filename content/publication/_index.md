All of my publications are listed below. If you'd like to read one, click the **DOI button** for the published version appearing in its respective journal. If you hit a paywall, in most cases you can still access the peer-reviewed version by clicking the **Postprint button**. In the event any of the more recent papers haven't yet cleared the publisher's embargo period for sharing postprints, please [contact me](https://jnix.netlify.app/#contact) to request a copy. 

In some cases you might see a **Preprint button**. Unless otherwise noted, these have not yet cleared the peer review process.
