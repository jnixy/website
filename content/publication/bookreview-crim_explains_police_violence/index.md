abstract: In this book, Stinson provides the best available data on police violence and misconduct, respectively, and discusses the challenges to holding officers accountable when they abuse their authority or break the law. He discusses the various criminological theories that should guide research on these matters, thus providing a roadmap for future research in an area that has been largely atheoretical and plagued by inadequate data.
