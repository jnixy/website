abstract: My brief review of Frank Zimring's book on police use of deadly force. Zimring carefully navigates multiple datasets to draw conclusions about what we know - and don't know - about citizen deaths at the hands of police. He makes several policy recommendations which he believes can eliminate 50 to 80% of police killings without jeapordizing the lives of officers or drastically changing the way they do their jobs.
