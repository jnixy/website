# Abstract
abstract = "American policing is a unique occupation, in part because officers are expected to confront violence. Understanding patterns in violence against police is vital to inform efforts aimed at enhancing both officer and public safety. To help researchers navigate the current landscape of data available to investigate violence against police, this chapter critically examines the fragmented and delayed nature of current federal, state, and non-profit data sources that include LEOKA, NIBRS, ODMP, NLEOMF, and the GVA. By highlighting the strengths and limitations of each dataset, we underscore the need for more comprehensive and timely data. Additionally, we review empirical research that has leveraged these datasets, exploring factors influencing trends in violence against officers and identifying key areas for future research. We conclude with recommendations for enhancing data collection and research to inform policies aimed at reducing violence against police and improving overall public safety."
