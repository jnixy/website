### Background

- DV-related calls for police service increased directly after stay-at-home orders[^1]
- The majority of DV victims **do not call** the police after incidents of partner violence[^2]
- DV victims may seek out help from victim service organizations - commonly through emergency DV hotlines[^3]
- Victim reports to *emergency DV hotlines* may provide important information about DV trends during COVID-19

---

### Purpose

- Examine the observed trend in DV calls for service to police and emergency hotlines before and during COVID-19
- Estimate the expected trend (i.e., *counterfactual*) in DV calls for service to police and emergency hotlines during COVID-19
- Compare differences in the observed and expected trends for DV calls for service to police and emergency hotlines during COVID-19

---

### Data

- Seven U.S. cities: Baltimore, MD; Cincinnati, OH; Hartford, CT; Orlando, FL; Sacramento, CA; Salt Lake City, UT; and St. Petersburg, FL
-- Police calls for service were obtained from the Police Data Initiative
-- Emergency hotline calls were obtained directly from the victim service agencies
- Study period: January 1, 2018 to October 31, 2020; COVID-related period: March 9 to October 31, 2020[^4]

---

### Analyses

- **Observed Trend** - Bayesian Structural Time Series (BSTS) models are estimated for police calls for service (CFS) and emergency hotline calls (EHC) in each city using 2018 and 2019 data (i.e., non-COVID period)
- **Expected Trend** - BSTS models are then used to estimate a counterfactual for CFS and EHC in each jurisdiction between March 9 and October 31, 2020 (i.e., COVID period)
- **Differences** - mean differences between the observed and expected trends are calculated for the COVID period, providing estimates of the impact on CFS and EHC in each jurisdiction

---

### Findings: Police CFS

- Increases in law enforcement calls were observed in Baltimore, Sacramento, and Salt Lake City
- Increases ranged from 1.64 more calls per day on average to 7.16 more calls per day on average, for a **total of 1030.32 more calls to law enforcement** from March 9 to October 31, 2020

---

### Findings: Emergency Hotline Calls

- Increases in the average number of calls to emergency hotlines were observed for Baltimore, Cincinnati, Hartford, Salt Lake City, and St. Petersburg
- These increases ranged from 2.31 more calls per day on average to 4.64 more calls per day on average, for a **total of 1670.85 more calls to emergency hotlines** from March 9 to October 31, 2020

---

### Findings: Comparisons

- General increases in calls for DV service, but variation across cities in whether increases in calls to law enforcement, emergency hotlines, or both
- Sacramento experienced an increase in calls to law enforcement only while Cincinnati, Hartford, and St. Petersburg experienced increases in calls to emergency hotlines only
- Baltimore and Salt Lake City experienced an increase in calls to both law enforcement and emergency hotlines
- Orlando experienced a decrease in calls to both law enforcement and emergency hotlines

---

### Discussion

- Law enforcement calls only tell us part of the story about DV help seeking during COVID-19
- Emergency hotlines/advocates shouldered a significant burden
- Critical to understand local effects, localized impacts on agencies
- As COVID recedes, we cannot forget about the “pandemic within the pandemic” - ongoing economic stressors associated with DV are not easily/quickly solved

---

### Implications

- Can we develop a culture of better data sharing and usage within/across criminal justice and victim service agencies?
-- Better understand localized trends, deploy training and resources in real time
- Can strategic research-practitioner partnerships help domestic violence coordinated community response teams?
-- Data-driven decisions regarding local prevention and intervention (e.g., pop-up advocacy sites, well-checks for DV “hotspots”)
