At ASC this year, I am participating in a [thematic panel](https://convention2.allacademic.com/one/asc/asc19/index.php?cmd=Online+Program+View+Session&selected_session_id=1538326&PHPSESSID=c56c4c6v1anm30a115i2rukmt3) organized by [Ross Deuchar](https://research-portal.uws.ac.uk/en/persons/ross-deuchar) of the University of the West of Scotland. The theme is "International Perspectives on Policing Communities, Procedural Justice and Legitimacy."

My paper (with Natalie Todak and Brandon Tregle) explores the factors associated with the adoption of body-worn cameras, using survey data from a national sample of municipal police departments. We also examine variation in police executives' perceived importance of being transparent with their communities about things such as allegations of officer misconduct, use of force incidents, and changes in police tactics.

Other presenters include:

- Vaughn Crichlow and Seth Fallik (FAU)
- T. Wing Lo (City University of Hong Kong) and Sharon Kwok (Western Sydney University)
- James Densley (Metropolitan State University) and Johanne Miller (University of the West of Scotland)

So come check out our work __at 5PM on Wednesday__ in __Pacific B, 4th Level__. Then head over to the __Atrium (2nd Level)__ at 8PM for a [reception](https://convention2.allacademic.com/one/asc/asc19/index.php?cmd=Online+Program+View+Session&selected_session_id=1537392&PHPSESSID=c56c4c6v1anm30a115i2rukmt3) jointly hosted by UNO, UCF, and VCU!
