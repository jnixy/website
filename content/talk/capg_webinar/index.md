Scott Mourtgos and I were recently invited to present some of our research during a webinar hosted by the Canadian Association of Police Governance. According to their website: 

> The Canadian Association of Police Governance (CAPG) is the only national organization dedicated to excellence in police governance in Canada. Since 1989, the CAPG has worked diligently to achieve the highest standards as the national voice of civilian oversight of municipal police. We have grown to represent 80% of municipal police services throughout Canada.  

Here are some of the studies we discussed:
