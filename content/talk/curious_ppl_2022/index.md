abstract: "My talk provides a broad overview of the research on police use of deadly force â€“ how often it happens, where it happens, and why it happens. I'll also point out the holes in our knowledge due to data constraints. I conclude with a discussion of promising approaches to reducing police shootings as well as the use of force more generally."
