abstract: "In 2014, NIJ established the Law Enforcement Advancing Data and Science (LEADS) Scholars Program to support research-minded, mid-career sworn law enforcement officers working to integrate research into agency policy and practice. The LEADS Scholars Program helps participants develop independent research and provides support to identify current evidence on priority issues. LEADS Scholars participate in activities supporting their professional growth, such as attending virtual and in-person trainings, joining an online community of practice, publishing in journals and trade magazines, presenting to law enforcement agencies at national conferences, and establishing leadership positions in evidence-based research groups. To further the reach and impact of the program, in 2019, NIJ added two additional categories of scholars - LEADS Civilians and LEADS Academics. Panelists discuss what the program has meant to them, how it has impacted their careers, and how it has helped them advance research and evidence in the policing profession."

I was lucky enough to share the stage with fellow LEADS Scholars to discuss what the program has meant to us for the past 10 years.[^1]
