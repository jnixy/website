I was recently a guest on Dr. Scott Phillips' new podcast, "Police In-Service Training." In Scott's words:

> This podcast is dedicated to providing research evidence to street-level police officers and command staff alike.  The program is intended to provide research in a jargon-free manner that cuts through the noise, misinformation, and misperceptions about the police.  The discussions with policing experts will help the law enforcement community create better programs, understand challenging policies, and dispel myths of police officer behavior.  

In my episode, we discussed procedural justice theory, including some of my own work on the topic, including:

* [Understanding the bounds of legitimacy: Weber’s facets of legitimacy and the police empowerment hypothesis](https://doi.org/10.1080/07418825.2021.1933141)
* [Testing a theoretical model of perceived audience legitimacy: The neglected linkage in the dialogic model of police-community relations](https://doi.org/10.1177/0022427819873957)
* [Compliance, noncompliance, and the inbetween: Causal effects of civilian demeanor on police officers’ cognitions and emotions](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11292-019-09363-4)
* [Demeanor, race, and police perceptions of procedural justice: Evidence from two randomized experiments](https://doi.org/10.1080/07418825.2017.1334808)
* [Sensitivity to the Ferguson Effect: The role of managerial organizational justice](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcrimjus.2016.06.002)

We also touch on some of the following:

* [Police Reform and the Dismantling of Legal Estrangement](https://www.jstor.org/stable/45222555) by Monica Bell
* [Assessing the direct and indirect effects of legitimacy on public empowerment of police: A study of public support for police militarization in America](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/lasr.12379) by Rick Moule et al.
* [Beyond procedural justice: A dialogic approach to legitimacy in criminal justice](https://heinonline.org/HOL/P?h=hein.journals/jclc102&i=129) by Anthony Bottoms & Justice Tankebe
