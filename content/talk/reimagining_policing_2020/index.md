My colleagues over in the [UNO School of Public Administration](https://www.unomaha.edu/college-of-public-affairs-and-community-service/public-administration/index.php) developed a special topics course this semester called *Pandemics, Protest, and Policy.* I've been asked to facilitate the discussion tomorrow night on "Police Reforms, Oversight, and De-Funding." 

I enjoy speaking with other classes, and in this case, it's one comprised of non-CJ majors. Generally, I prefer an unstructured format in these settings so that the discussion goes where the students want it to go. But my colleagues have put a lot of thought and planning into this, so I felt compelled to put some slides together. 

So, given the opportunity to discuss U.S. policing in 2020 with a (virtual) room full of non-CJ majors, what would you say are the ***most pressing*** issues? If you're reading this, I'd love to hear your thoughts.
