For our SCCJ Grad Seminar Series, I put together this crash course on building a professional website in RStudio with [Wowchemy](https://wowchemy.com/). I'm sharing it here in case others might be interested. Following these basic steps **should** get you up and running in less than an hour. If you think I've missed an important step, please [let me know](https://jnix.netlify.app/#contact)!
