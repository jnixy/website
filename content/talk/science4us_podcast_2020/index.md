The [Lydia Foundation for Social Engagement](https://www.lydia.foundation/) has a podcast called "Science for the Rest of Us." As they describe it:

> Science...is boring – but so important!  Science and Technology drive society forward and Science for the Rest of Us is here to talk about it.  We have conversations with Nerds in the Know and explore the science behind our lives.

> Science shouldn’t be the last word in our civic discourse – it should be the first.  We can all strive to understand the basic facts of each issue, and then apply our social, ethical and religious values to plot a course forward -- together.

> *Science For the Rest of Us* exists because it's much more fun to learn than it is to fight.  After all, where is the time to hate when there is so little time to love?

Personally, I would push back on the "science is boring" bit! :smile: 

In this episode, we cover a range of policing topics - use of force, racial disparities, reform, and so on.
