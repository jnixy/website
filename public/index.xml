      <title>Body-worn cameras and transparency: Experimental evidence of inconsistency in police executive decision-making</title>
      <link>https://jnix.netlify.app/publication/35-jq-bwc-transparency/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 03 Sep 2020 06:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://jnix.netlify.app/publication/35-jq-bwc-transparency/</guid>
      <description>&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUMMARY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Body-worn cameras (BWCs) have &lt;a href=&#34;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1098611120917937&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;rapidly diffused&lt;/a&gt; throughout US policing over the last decade. As of 2016, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/bwclea16.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;47 percent&lt;/a&gt; of all general-purpose law enforcement agencies had acquired BWCs. The general idea is that BWCs will increase transparency and accountability - and maybe even improve police-citizen interactions. The extant literature is rather mixed, but BWCs have consistently been shown to reduce complaints against officers.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Yet, a &lt;a href=&#34;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1745-9133.12412&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;recent meta review&lt;/a&gt; of 70 evaluation studies by Cynthia Lum and her colleagues concluded that &amp;ldquo;expectations and concerns surrounding BWCs among police leaders and citizens have not yet been realized by and large in the ways anticipated by each&amp;rdquo; (p. 93).&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing my coauthors and I have noticed is how inconsistent agencies seem to be about releasing footage of critical incidents (e.g., use of force incidents) to the public. According to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ncsl.org/research/civil-and-criminal-justice/body-worn-cameras-interactive-graphic.aspx#/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;National Conference of State Legislatures&lt;/a&gt;, 23 states and the District of Columbia have legislation pertaining to how BWC footage is addressed under open record laws. Yet even in those states, there are many exemptions that give police leaders the discretion to delay or withhold footage. To be sure, there may be legitimate reasons to do so (e.g., protecting victims or informants). But one thing seems clear: the public expects BWC footage of critical incidents to be released quickly. When it isn&amp;rsquo;t, agencies risk diminishing their legitimacy in the eyes of the public - many of whom might suspect they&amp;rsquo;re hiding something. Ironically, then, BWCs &lt;em&gt;reduce&lt;/em&gt; transparency if agencies have them but fail to release footage of critical incidents quickly.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For our new experimental study forthcoming in &lt;em&gt;Justice Quarterly&lt;/em&gt;, we presented a nationally representative sample&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; of police chiefs (N=476) with the following hypothetical vignette:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While on patrol, officers from your agency are dispatched to a home invasion in progress in a residential area. The caller describes the suspect as a [Black/white] male. One of your officers arrives on-scene and makes contact with a [Black/white] male who fits this description in front of the house. The suspect has his hands in his pockets and does not comply with your officer’s commands to show his hands. The suspect then quickly removes his hands from his pocket holding an object. Your officer fires at the suspect, killing him on the scene. Afterward, the officer finds that the object was a [handgun/cellphone]. The officer’s BWC captures full audio and video of the incident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that the suspect&amp;rsquo;s race was randomly assigned, as was the object he pulled from his pocket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We then asked the chiefs a series of questions about how they envisioned the aftermath of the shooting, including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How they believed the incident would be portrayed by the media&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How important they felt it would be to state publicly that the shooting was justified&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How important they personally felt it would be (regardless of law or policy) to release the footage quickly, make a statement to the media within 24 hours, keep the community updated on social media, and so on (see p. 9 of the post-print linked above)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For detailed results, download the full text. But the big picture takeaway is that chiefs&amp;rsquo; attitudes and decision-making were inconsistent. In addition to the suspect&amp;rsquo;s race and whether he was armed or unarmed, the size of responding chiefs&amp;rsquo; agencies (in terms of the number of sworn officers) seemed to affect their views about the incident. For example, chiefs in the smallest agencies seemed to think media coverage of the shooting would be similar regardless of whether the suspect had pulled a gun or a cellphone from his pocket. But in larger agencies - and particularly in the largest agencies - chiefs clearly felt media coverage would be more hostile if the object had been a cellphone:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://jnix.netlify.app/img/jq_bwcs_media.png&#34; alt=&#34;bwc_trans1&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So clearly something about agency size conditions the way executives view shootings like these, and how they respond to them when they&amp;rsquo;re recorded by BWCs. We were able to rule out urbanicity and violent crime (see Appendix E), but perhaps it has more to do with an agency&amp;rsquo;s recent history (or lack thereof) with critical incidents akin to the one we described (h/t to the peer reviewers for suggesting this supplemental analysis).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the broadest sense, our results suggest that legislation dictating when BWC footage must be released might be necessary. &lt;strong&gt;Details about an incident - such as whether the victim is Black or white, or whether he was armed or unarmed - should not influence whether the public gets to see the footage.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34;&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;It is unclear &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; they reduce complaints, however. Maybe they improve officer behavior, maybe citizens are less likely to file frivolous complaints, maybe a little bit of both.
 &lt;a class=&#34;footnote-return&#34; href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;^&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:2&#34;&gt;I believe this team also has a meta analysis of experimental and quasi-experimental evaluation studies forthcoming in &lt;em&gt;Campbell Systematic Reviews.&lt;/em&gt; 
 &lt;a class=&#34;footnote-return&#34; href=&#34;#fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;^&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:3&#34;&gt;As I write this, people are protesting in Rochester after BWC footage of Daniel Prude&amp;rsquo;s March 23rd arrest was just released (Prude wound up on life support and died 7 days later). Or consider the fatal shooting of Keith Lamont Scott in Charlotte. The incident was recorded by BWCs, but footage wasn&amp;rsquo;t released for 4 days. During that time, violent protests resulted in dozens of civilian injuries and one death. Or consider the altercation between an Alameda County sheriff&amp;rsquo;s deputy and Masai Ujiri (president of basketball operations for the Toronto Raptors) during the 2019 NBA finals. For whatever reason, BWC footage wasn&amp;rsquo;t made publicly available until over a year later, as a result of a countersuit Ujiri filed against the deputy. The footage &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/raptors/2020/08/18/new-video-officer-shoves-masai-ujiri-during-altercation-nba-finals/3398114001/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;seems to depict&lt;/a&gt; the deputy as the aggressor. 
 &lt;a class=&#34;footnote-return&#34; href=&#34;#fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;^&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:4&#34;&gt;We mailed surveys to a stratified random sample of 2,496 police chiefs. We stratified on agency size: 0-24, 25-49, 50-99, or 100+ full-time, sworn officers. We achieved a 27% response rate. But don&amp;rsquo;t get me started on whether that&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;good&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;bad.&amp;rdquo;
 &lt;a class=&#34;footnote-return&#34; href=&#34;#fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;^&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>NYC Shootings, Revisited</title>
      <link>https://jnix.netlify.app/post/post12-nyc-shootings-revisited/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 26 Aug 2020 19:30:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://jnix.netlify.app/post/post12-nyc-shootings-revisited/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my &lt;a href=&#34;https://jnix.netlify.app/post/post11-nyc-covid-shootings/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;last post&lt;/a&gt;, I pointed out that shootings weren&amp;rsquo;t occurring less frequently in NYC in 2020 than in prior years, despite the COVID-19 pandemic. I was also careful not to jump to the conclusion that shootings had increased significantly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was June 3rd. Suffice it to say a lot has happened since then - including &lt;strong&gt;624 additional shootings.&lt;/strong&gt; Each of the last four years, NYC had fewer than 200 shootings from June to July. This year, they had &lt;strong&gt;449&lt;/strong&gt;. As of August 26th, there have been 965 shootings this year, which is a year-to-date increase of &lt;strong&gt;88 percent&lt;/strong&gt;. In fact, NYC &lt;em&gt;finished&lt;/em&gt; each of the last &lt;em&gt;three years&lt;/em&gt; with fewer than 800 shootings by my count.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the (rolling) average daily number of shootings, dating back to January 1, 2016:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://jnix.netlify.app/img/nyc_shootings_4.png&#34; alt=&#34;NYC4&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These alarming figures have led some, myself included, to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/ny-oped-the-end-of-crime-decline-20200719-e77s74cv7nhxjllosarp74lp2u-story.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;wonder&lt;/a&gt; whether NYC is approaching the end of its decades-long crime decline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sure hope it&amp;rsquo;s just a blip and not the start of a new trend.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>No Significant Decline in NYC Shootings Amidst COVID-19 Pandemic</title>
      <link>https://jnix.netlify.app/post/post11-nyc-covid-shootings/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 03 Jun 2020 09:30:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://jnix.netlify.app/post/post11-nyc-covid-shootings/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;On March 1, 2020, New York City reported its first confirmed case of COVID-19. Eleven days later, Mayor de Blasio declared a state of emergency. By mid-March, the most populous city in America had essentially shut down. Schools, libraries, gyms, theaters, churches and nightclubs closed. Major sporting events and concerts were cancelled. Restaurants were limited to take-out and delivery only. Non-essential gatherings of any size were prohibited, and New Yorkers were ordered to “shelter in place.” As of today, the city is reporting over 205,000 confirmed cases and over 16,000 deaths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How have these significant disruptions to daily life in NYC affected crime, and in particular, &lt;strong&gt;shootings&lt;/strong&gt;? Other cities have witnessed an array of trends in &lt;strong&gt;gun violence&lt;/strong&gt; (i.e., crimes committed with a firearm) amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. In Dallas and Tucson, for example, gun violence increased despite decreases in other violent crimes. In Nashville and Philadelphia, gun violence remained stable. Meanwhile, in other cities – including Baltimore, Chicago, Los Angeles, New Orleans, and Washington, DC – gun violence decreased.&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; Here in Omaha, the local police department reports that shootings and “shots fired” calls have increased.&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak in the US, NYC has experienced a more drastic shock to daily life than other cities. For example, a state serology study of COVID-19 in New York found that 1 in 4 people in NYC had antibodies that suggested they had been infected. This compared to antibody prevalence of 3.4% in New York state (excluding NYC, Long Island, Westchester, and Rockland).&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt; Consider also that a county health department study of serology in Los Angeles found a prevalence of antibodies in 4.1% of adults in LA county.&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt; Clearly, NYC has been hit harder by COVID-19 than other major cities, so the effects of the pandemic on crime may be more pronounced there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Curious about what happened in NYC, I teamed up with NIJ LEADS Scholar John Hall (NYPD) and fellow LEADS Academic &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/Clempoliceprof&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Kyle McLean&lt;/a&gt; (Clemson University). First, we simply examined trends in shootings in 2020. There had been 341 shootings as of June 2nd, with the daily total ranging from 0 to 9 with a mean of 2.2:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://jnix.netlify.app/img/nyc_shootings_1.png&#34; alt=&#34;NYC1&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The daily total bounces around so much that it’s difficult to draw any conclusions about the trend. So, we next smoothed out some of the noise by plotting the 7-day running mean:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://jnix.netlify.app/img/nyc_shootings_2.png&#34; alt=&#34;NYC2&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It looks like there was a brief uptick following the first reported COVID-19 case, then a brief decline following the state of emergency declaration, and an upward trend throughout April and May.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, this can be &lt;em&gt;highly misleading&lt;/em&gt; for at least two reasons. First, the data are still noisy. We really need more data before we can draw any meaningful conclusions about trends. Second, we don’t know what might’ve happened in 2020 &lt;em&gt;absent&lt;/em&gt; the COVID-19 pandemic. Shootings undoubtedly increase in New York every year as the weather gets warmer. So we need a reasonable counterfactual to compare against in order to make sense of what we’ve observed in 2020 thus far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this in mind, we next examined trends in shootings from January 1, 2016 through June 2, 2020. In the graph below, we’ve imposed the 2020 trend line (as of June 2nd) over the trend lines for each of the previous four years. Here, the lines represent 7-day running means, to smooth out some of the day-to-day noisiness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://jnix.netlify.app/img/nyc_shootings_3.png&#34; alt=&#34;NYC3&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Viewed in this way, the recent uptick NYC has observed in 2020 doesn’t appear inconsistent with what happened each of the last four years. So while we can confidently say that shootings &lt;strong&gt;haven’t declined&lt;/strong&gt; amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, the data don’t really suggest that shootings are significantly up, either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s all agree to be skeptical of vague hot-takes like &lt;strong&gt;“Crime is down!”&lt;/strong&gt; It’s way more nuanced – and localized – than that.&lt;sup&gt;[5-9]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can download incident-level shooting data from the NYPD &lt;a href=&#34;https://www1.nyc.gov/site/nypd/stats/crime-statistics/citywide-crime-stats.page&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Gun Violence Against U.S. Police Officers: Insights from a New Dataset</title>
      <link>https://jnix.netlify.app/post/post10-gvaanalysis/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 20 May 2020 06:30:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://jnix.netlify.app/post/post10-gvaanalysis/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In a forthcoming paper in &lt;em&gt;Criminology &amp;amp; Public Policy&lt;/em&gt;, Michael and I conducted an exploratory analysis of fatal and non-fatal firearm assaults on U.S police officers using six years of public data provided by the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Gun Violence Archive&lt;/a&gt;. We adopted the following inclusion criteria:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Victim was a sworn officer employed by a local, state, or special jurisdiction law enforcement agency that routinely responds to calls for service (i.e., officers employed by town, city, or county agencies, sheriff’s departments, state agencies, tribal police, university police, transit police)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Victim was on duty at the time of assault&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The bullet struck the victim’s person or his/her equipment (excluding vehicle)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The bullet came from a real firearm (i.e., not a pellet/BB gun or shrapnel from an explosion)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The shooter was not a police officer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We excluded off-duty firearm injuries, self-inflicted injuries (whether accidental or intentional), and injuries resulting from friendly fire. Our analysis also omitted cases in which a suspect fired at but did not strike an officer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We identified 1,467 officers who were assaulted by gunfire across 1,185 incidents (1.24 officers per incident). Of them, 249 died and 1,218 survived. This underscores the importance of examining nonlethal shootings alongside fatal shootings in order to understand the true prevalence of potentially lethal violence against police officers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the national level, the rate of firearm assaults per 100,000 sworn officers has fluctuated between 29.9 and 44.1 over the last six years. Though there was a notable spike in 2016, the data don’t provide clear evidence of a significant increase in firearm assaults of police officers over this period. This finding is in line with a recent &lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.1177/1098611120919441&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; by Michael White that focused on ambush-style attacks on police: despite some single-year spikes, there is no evidence of a longitudinal increase in ambushes against police.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the state level, the number of firearm assaults ranged from a low of 2 (in Delaware, Montana, North Dakota, Rhode Island, and Vermont) to a high of 143 in Texas:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://jnix.netlify.app/img/GVA1.png&#34; alt=&#34;GVA1&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This ordering is unsurprising for a simple reason: there are far more officers in Texas than most other states. To account for differences across states in the number of police officers, we calculated state-level rates per 1,000 officers using Police Employee data provided by the FBI. Using these rates provides a different view of the relative incidence of firearm assault across states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://jnix.netlify.app/img/GVA2.png&#34; alt=&#34;GVA2&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of being at the top of the list, Texas falls to 18th. California, which has the 2nd highest frequency of firearm assault on police, falls to 38th when using a rate. Overall, rates varied from a low of 0.06 firearm assaults per 1,000 officers in Connecticut to a high of 1.56 per 1,000 in New Mexico (at first glance, Mississippi’s rate is higher, but this rate is biased by statewide underreporting of Police Employee data to the UCR).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When looking at things spatially, some interesting patterns emerge. Generally, Northeastern states have a lower firearm assault rate than states in the South Eastern and South Western United States. However, the story is not strictly regional: Utah and California’s rates, for example, are more similar to New York and Massachusetts than to nearby Arizona and New Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://jnix.netlify.app/img/GVA3.png&#34; alt=&#34;GVA3&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The behind the scenes work with GVA data also provides some really important lessons for future work. Early on, we made the decision to manually vet each case by using the news story URLs that GVA includes with each assault record. In cases where links were dead or missing, we did manual searches using the listed date, location, and other details to try and find an online record with which to verify case details. I shudder remembering about how long this took us (thanks to Kateryna Kaplan at Rutgers SCJ for her help with this arduous task!), but it proved to be a valuable experience. We ultimately excluded &lt;strong&gt;510 incidents&lt;/strong&gt; from the original dataset which didn’t meet our inclusion criteria—&lt;strong&gt;over 25% of the raw data we received from GVA!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A handful of cases were &lt;em&gt;incredibly&lt;/em&gt; difficult to adjudicate and illustrate just how challenging it can be to boil down complex social realities into even seemingly straightforward variables like fatal/nonfatal. Consider Sgt. Ron Helus of the Ventura County Sheriff’s Department, who was shot six times while responding to an active shooter situation. Five of those shots were fired by the suspect, but the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/officer-killed-responding-to-thousand-oaks-mass-shooting-was-fatally-struck-by-friendly-fire-police-say/2018/12/07/e7405186-fa52-11e8-8c9a-860ce2a8148f_story.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Coroner&lt;/a&gt; ruled that the sixth and ultimately fatal shot was fired from the rifle of another officer. We decided to retain this incident as a &lt;em&gt;nonfatal&lt;/em&gt; shooting because, though we were certain he was shot by a suspect, we could not say whether he would have died had he not been struck in the heart by friendly fire. Others might have coded this incident differently. What is very clear is that this sort of data must be coded and analyzed with caution and transparency. Taking GVA data (or &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; crowdsourced data, for that matter) at face value is not advised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We finish out the paper with discussion of future directions for research and data collection efforts focused on force by and against police. It’s scheduled for inclusion in the August 2020 Special Issue on Policing but will appear &lt;em&gt;online first&lt;/em&gt; sometime before then.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Police Shooting Research and the Conditional Probability Mistake</title>
      <link>https://jnix.netlify.app/post/post9-response-to-aw/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 27 Jan 2020 14:30:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://jnix.netlify.app/post/post9-response-to-aw/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, Andy Wheeler &lt;a href=&#34;https://andrewpwheeler.com/2020/01/26/statement-on-recent-officer-involved-shooting-research/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; a summary of the problems with recent studies about officer-involved shootings, including &lt;a href=&#34;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1745-9133.12269&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;one&lt;/a&gt; my colleagues and I published in February 2017. As usual, Andy’s criticisms were thoughtful and spot on. And I hope I can take him up on that conference beer soon, even though he’s at a new job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, I do want to push back just &lt;em&gt;a little&lt;/em&gt; about the motivation for our paper. Brad and I had the idea for it because journalists and activists were getting the denominator wrong when they tried to interpret the (at the time) new WAPO &amp;amp; Guardian data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember daily conversations with Brad and Geoff about what we could and could not learn from these new crowdsourced data in the absence of a meaningful benchmark. Ultimately, we felt it was informative to determine whether - strictly in this universe we had data on (i.e., fatal shootings) - race was correlated with having been unarmed while controlling for threat. At the very least, we thought it was a more reasonable way of analyzing the data than how it was being used at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We really tried to be transparent about the limitations of the data:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://jnix.netlify.app/img/AW1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;AW1&#34; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://jnix.netlify.app/img/AW2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;AW2&#34; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://jnix.netlify.app/img/AW3.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;AW3&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, with the benefit of hindsight, we’d be even more careful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I agree wholeheartedly with Andy that &lt;em&gt;the question of whether &amp;ldquo;the police&amp;rdquo; are racially biased is a facile question.&lt;/em&gt; But I also recognize it’s a question that journalists, activists, and others routinely try to answer simply by looking at raw numbers reported by WAPO or &lt;em&gt;Mapping Police Violence&lt;/em&gt; (or at most, benchmarking them against the general population). Consistent with the first retort Andy said he often hears, I feel it is our responsibility as social scientists to learn what we can from the data we have, and push for better data so that we can continue to learn more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then, I’ve written extensively about the importance of using better benchmarks to understand disparities in policing. See for example, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0735648X.2018.1547269&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07418825.2019.1675748&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047235219304398&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s complex, to say the least.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And now, thanks to Knox, Lowe, and Mummolo’s fascinating &lt;a href=&#34;https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3336338&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;forthcoming paper&lt;/a&gt;, I realize it’s even more complex than a lot of us thought.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, Andy hit the nail on the head here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://jnix.netlify.app/img/AW5.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;AW5&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got some pretty nasty emails after that CPP paper, and occasionally still have my motives questioned by folks on both sides. It’s unfortunate, because I think that sort of thing scares a lot of really sharp people away from doing this research.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>New preprint: Do police killings of unarmed persons really have spillover effects?</title>
      <link>https://jnix.netlify.app/post/post8-bor-replication/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2020 09:30:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://jnix.netlify.app/post/post8-bor-replication/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In 2018, &lt;em&gt;The Lancet&lt;/em&gt; published a quasi-experimental &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(18)31130-9/fulltext&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; by Jacob Bor, Atheendar Venkataramani, David Williams, and Alexander Tsai (hereafter BVWT) that alleged &amp;ldquo;police killings of unarmed black Americans have effects on mental health among black American adults in the general population&amp;rdquo; (p. 302). From this, BVWT extrapolated that police killings of unarmed black Americans may cause as many as 55 million poor mental health days each year among black adults in the US, an effect &amp;ldquo;nearly as large as the mental health burden associated with diabetes&amp;rdquo; (p. 308).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS0140-6736(18)33043-5.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;written correspondence&lt;/a&gt; published alongside the study, James Lozada and I pointed out several cases in their data that were misclassified as involving unarmed decedents, when in fact they were in posession of deadly weapons. We also argued that individuals in posession of toy/replica firearms should have been coded &amp;ldquo;armed&amp;rdquo; instead of &amp;ldquo;unarmed.&amp;rdquo; BVWT &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(18)33060-5/fulltext&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;replied&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ldquo;[a]lthough some degree of misclassification of exposure is possible, it is improbable to have substantially affected our estimates or conclusions.&amp;rdquo; Surprisingly, they did not revisit their data or analyses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to December 2019. &lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt; published a &lt;a href=&#34;https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/5/12/eaax7894&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; which employed a similar methodology and claimed to show a causal relationship between exposure to police killings of unarmed black persons and decreased birth weight among black infants in California. The article was &lt;a href=&#34;https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/5/12/eaba5491&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;retracted&lt;/a&gt; 8 days later after a reader found several misclassified incidents which, when corrected, rendered the author&amp;rsquo;s primary finding non-significant. Seeing how this played out, we couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but wonder if the same might be true of BVWT&amp;rsquo;s article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a new &lt;a href=&#34;https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ajz2q/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;preprint&lt;/a&gt;, James and I reexamined 303 police killings in BVWT&amp;rsquo;s study that were classified as involving &amp;ldquo;unarmed black victims.&amp;rdquo; We identified 91 incidents that were misclassified (i.e., 30% of all &amp;ldquo;unarmed black victims&amp;rdquo;). The table below summarizes them (additional details are available in the study&amp;rsquo;s appendix).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://jnix.netlify.app/img/bor_rep_tab1.png&#34; alt=&#34;bor_misclassifications&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, many of the misclassified incidents involved people who were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(1) not killed intentionally by on-duty police officers (n=52)&lt;/strong&gt;, or&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(2) armed with a weapon/struggling for officer&amp;rsquo;s firearm (n=13)&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another &lt;strong&gt;26 incidents&lt;/strong&gt; involved individuals in posession of toy/replica firearms or objects that might have reasonably resembled a deadly weapon (e.g., David Andre Scott told SWAT officers he wasn&amp;rsquo;t coming out of his house without a fight, then came out screaming and pointing a black object at officers, which they later discovered was a small box shoved inside of a black sock). Whether these individuals should be coded &amp;ldquo;armed&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;unarmed&amp;rdquo; is debatable. BVWT remarked &amp;ldquo;the fact that 12-year-old Tamir Rice was armed with an Airsoft replica gun did little to assuage concerns in the community about the conduct of former officer Timothy Loehmann.&amp;rdquo; Seemingly, their point was that community members may believe police killings of persons armed with toy guns are injustices on par with police killings of persons who have neither a weapon nor anything resembling a weapon. Thus, BVWT suggest it is reasonable to lump them all together as &amp;ldquo;unarmed victims.&amp;rdquo; We respectfully disagree, but this is ultimately an empirical question. As such, BVWT should have conducted a supplemental analysis whereby anyone with a toy gun was treated as armed. In this way, they could have determined whether their findings were sensitive to the coding of these highly controversial incidents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/VGYI0E&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;data and code&lt;/a&gt; made available by BVWT, we first successfully replicated the results reported in Table 3 of their study. Then, we dropped the 52 individuals who weren&amp;rsquo;t killed intentionally by on-duty cops, and re-coded as &amp;ldquo;armed&amp;rdquo; 13 individuals who were misclassified as &amp;ldquo;unarmed.&amp;rdquo; Upon re-estimating the authors&amp;rsquo; models, we found that all of the coefficients decreased in magnitude and were no longer statistically significant. Finally, we recoded the 26 individuals who had toy guns or objects resembling weapons as &amp;ldquo;armed&amp;rdquo; and again re-estimated their models. Again, the coefficients were smaller than in the original study and not statistically significant. In other words, using the corrected data, &lt;strong&gt;we did not find a statistically significant &amp;ldquo;spillover effect&amp;rdquo; of police killings of unarmed black persons on the mental health of black Americans&lt;/strong&gt;. Furthermore, our failure to replicate BVWT&amp;rsquo;s findings was not due to our fundamental disagreement about how to code individuals with toy guns. It was because BVWT failed to remove dozens of incidents that should not have been included in their analyses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two final points are in order:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;First: researchers, journalists, and others who study/write about police use of deadly force &lt;strong&gt;must&lt;/strong&gt; be cautious when analyzing crowdsourced data, and describe their methods and results carefully. In the introduction of their paper, BVWT claimed &amp;ldquo;police kill more than 300 black Americans - at least a quarter of them unarmed - each year in the USA.&amp;rdquo; A closer inspection of their data revealed this claim is, at best, terribly misleading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second: we really need to move beyond reducing police deadly force incidents to whether the person was armed or unarmed. That&amp;rsquo;s not to suggest it isn&amp;rsquo;t useful information. But on its own, it&amp;rsquo;s a poor measure of the appropriateness of officer actions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Now in print: Three experiments concerned with the Demeanor Hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://jnix.netlify.app/post/post7-demeanor/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 04 Dec 2019 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://jnix.netlify.app/post/post7-demeanor/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In a new paper published in &lt;em&gt;Journal of Experimental Criminology&lt;/em&gt;, my colleagues and I revisit the Demeanor Hypothesis, which holds that police officers respond more punitively to citizens who disrespect them or challenge their authority. In the 1990s, David Klinger argued that prior work had often conflated demeanor with criminal conduct. Based on his &lt;a href=&#34;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1745-9125.1994.tb01162.x&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; of police-citizen encounters in Dade County in the 1980s, he concluded &amp;ldquo;displays of hostility which violate no laws do not increase the likelihood of arrest in and of themselves.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we outline on p. 616 of our new paper, it is difficult to draw conclusions about the causal effects of demeanor based on studies that use systematic social observation (i.e., researchers observe police-citizen encounters and code things like demeanor, use of coercion by officers, etc.) for several reasons. As one example, if a citizen&amp;rsquo;s behavior could be categorized as both disrespectful &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; noncompliant, how can we know which is influencing the officer&amp;rsquo;s decision making? We shouldn&amp;rsquo;t just assume post-hoc that the officer&amp;rsquo;s response was prompted by the citizen&amp;rsquo;s noncompliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our paper, we tested whether citizen disrespect heightens officers&amp;rsquo; suspicion and perceived danger, or causes them to feel more angry, frustrated, annoyed, or fearful. To do this, we presented 546 officers in a large southwestern agency with vignettes about routine police-citizen interactions (public order violation, traffic stop, suspicious person call) wherein the citizen&amp;rsquo;s demeanor was randomized (compliant, &lt;em&gt;bad attitude&lt;/em&gt;, or noncompliant). Importantly, the citizen with a &lt;em&gt;bad attitude&lt;/em&gt; obeyed the officer&amp;rsquo;s commands but did so in a disrespectful way (e.g., shouting, using profanity, calling the officer names, mocking the officer). This experimental design allowed us to isolate the effect of demeanor on officers&amp;rsquo; cognitive and emotional responses, which we expect to influence their behavioral responses, based on experimental evidence published in the field of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.lawsocsci.4.110707.172335&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;moral psychology&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across each experiment, we found that disrespect &lt;em&gt;in and of itself&lt;/em&gt; triggered suspicion, annoyance, and frustration among officers. In the suspicious person experiment, disrespect also caused officers to perceive the citizen as more dangerous. The next step, of course, is to determine whether these cognitions and emotions do in fact increase the likelihood of punitive behavioral responses by officers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For detailed results, &lt;strong&gt;you can download our article for free &lt;a href=&#34;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11292-019-09363-4&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (see pp. 626-27). Here&amp;rsquo;s a figure that nicely summarizes our findings:&lt;/p&gt;

The theme is &amp;ldquo;International Perspectives on Policing Communities, Procedural Justice and Legitimacy.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My paper (with Natalie Todak and Brandon Tregle) explores the factors associated with the adoption of body-worn cameras, using survey data from a national sample of municipal police departments. We also examine variation in police executives&amp;rsquo; perceived importance of being transparent with their communities about things such as allegations of officer misconduct, use of force incidents, and changes in police tactics.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>LEADS at IACP Conference in Chicago</title>
      <link>https://jnix.netlify.app/post/post6-iacp2019/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 31 Oct 2019 11:40:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://jnix.netlify.app/post/post6-iacp2019/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In 2014, the  Law Enforcement Advancing Data &amp;amp; Science (LEADS) Scholars Program was established through a partnership between the National Institute of Justice (NIJ) and the International Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP). The three-year program &amp;ldquo;aims to identify and nurture the next generation of law enforcement leadership through encouraging the use of evidence-based research to advance criminal justice.&amp;rdquo; By my count, 62 officers from around the US and Canada have gone through - or are currently participating in - the LEADS Scholars Program. This year, in addition to 12 &lt;em&gt;Scholars&lt;/em&gt;, LEADS also admitted two &lt;em&gt;Civilian Analysts&lt;/em&gt; and four &lt;em&gt;Academics&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;a href=&#34;https://nij.ojp.gov/bio/cory-haberman-0&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Cory Haberman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://nij.ojp.gov/bio/kyle-mclean&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Kyle McLean&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://nij.ojp.gov/bio/natalie-todak&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Natalie Todak&lt;/a&gt;, and me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our first order of business was to attend the 2019 IACP Conference in Chicago, which just ended yesterday. While there, I got to meet all of the current LEADS Scholars as well as a few alumni. We had a few roundtables where we discussed challenges and concerns surrounding the infusion of evidence into policing. We attended panels on recruitment/retention, social media, and pursuit policies. We sat in on IACP&amp;rsquo;s Research Advisory Committee meeting. We ate deep-dish pizza. But most importantly, we networked. I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to see where the program goes from here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The LEADS Scholars are truly an impressive bunch. You can read more about them, and the great work they&amp;rsquo;re doing in addition to their regular responsibilities, &lt;a href=&#34;https://nij.ojp.gov/topics/articles/law-enforcement-advancing-data-and-science-scholars-program&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>New research: Are domestic disturbances really more dangerous for responding officers?</title>
      <link>https://jnix.netlify.app/post/post5-domestics/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 26 Sep 2019 14:40:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://jnix.netlify.app/post/post5-domestics/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For decades, conventional wisdom has held that domestic incidents are inherently more dangerous to responding officers than other calls for service. That is, officers face an increased risk of being assaulted, injured, or killed on these calls. This was echoed as recently as 2016, when the COPS Office and NLEOMF released a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.hsdl.org/?abstract&amp;amp;did=794863&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; that alleged domestic disputes are &amp;ldquo;the most dangerous type [of call] for responding officers.&amp;rdquo; This conclusion was based on the fact that from 2010 to 2014, 22% of the 91 calls for service resulting in a police officer fatality were domestic disputes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that sort of analysis suffers from the same &amp;ldquo;denominator&amp;rdquo; problem that has historically plagued studies of racial disparities in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev-criminol-011518-024731&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;traffic stops&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0735648X.2018.1547269&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;officer-involved shootings&lt;/a&gt;. In order to make sense of how often officers &lt;strong&gt;were assaulted&lt;/strong&gt; during domestic and non-domsetic calls, respectively, we need to know how often they &lt;strong&gt;were not assaulted&lt;/strong&gt;. We can&amp;rsquo;t simply work backward from the number of fatalities that occur each year. The overwhelming majority of police-citizen interactions end without an officer being assaulted or killed. So, a better method is to consider an officer&amp;rsquo;s odds of being assaulted on a domestic call relative to an officer&amp;rsquo;s odds of being assaulted on other types of calls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our Forthcoming Study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a paper recently accepted for publication at &lt;em&gt;Justice Quarterly&lt;/em&gt;, my colleagues (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.unomaha.edu/college-of-public-affairs-and-community-service/criminology-and-criminal-justice/about-us/tara-richards.php&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Tara Richards&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.unlv.edu/people/gillian-pinchevsky&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Gillian Pinchevsky&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.unomaha.edu/college-of-public-affairs-and-community-service/criminology-and-criminal-justice/about-us/emily-wright.php&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Emily Wright&lt;/a&gt;) and I took this approach with 2016 National Incident Based Reporting System (NIBRS) data. NIBRS data is ideal for this research question because it includes information about victim-offender relationships as well as whether officers were assaulted and/or injured, among other things. Among the 1 million+ incidents with a documented victim-offender relationship in 2016, 0.23% of &lt;em&gt;domestic&lt;/em&gt; incidents involved an officer being assaulted, versus 2.11% of &lt;em&gt;non-domestic&lt;/em&gt; incidents. Similarly, just 0.15% of &lt;em&gt;domestic&lt;/em&gt; incidents involved an officer getting injured or killed, versus 0.81% of &lt;em&gt;non-domestic&lt;/em&gt; incidents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In subsequent logistic regression models, we estimated the odds of officers being assaulted or injured/killed while controlling for other relevant factors, including whether a violent offense had occurred, weapons or drugs/alcohol were involved, location, time of day, the number of parties involved, offender sex, and offender age. We arrived at the same conclusion: in 2016, domestic incidents were considerably less likely to result in officers being assaulted or injured/killed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can&amp;rsquo;t be sure &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; the numbers look this way. It could be that domestics are in fact far less dangerous than non-domestics. Or, it could be that officers have been trained and socialized to take extra precautions on these calls, which offsets any increased danger. The aformentioned COPS/NLEOMF report recommended having at least three officers respond to domestic calls &amp;ldquo;to adequately separate parties, monitor family members and, if necessary, physically restrain and arrest a suspect&amp;rdquo; (p. 16). If in fact officers are more likely to have backup on domestic calls, that could also explain the lower assault rates we observed. Unfortunately, NIBRS only includes such information when incidents resulted in an officer being assaulted (but not the hundreds of thousands of incidents wherein an officer was not assaulted).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FBI aims to transition completely from UCR to NIBRS by 2021. This is exciting, given how much richer NIBRS data are. Limitations remain, but my hope is that they will be addressed moving forward. For example, NIBRS currently instructs agencies to complete data on officer activity type (e.g., responding to a traffic incident, responding to a disturbance) &lt;em&gt;only when an officer is assaulted&lt;/em&gt;. A simple change in instruction - to complete this field for all incidents - would greatly improve research on officer wellness in the field. Again, to better understand trends in assaults and injuries to police officers, we need a more solid understanding of trends in non-assaults and non-injuries to police officers.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>New research: Police perceptions of their audience legitimacy</title>
      <link>https://jnix.netlify.app/post/post4-audience-legitimacy/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 15 Aug 2019 13:25:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year, I conducted two police surveys with the help of my colleagues Justin Pickett and Scott Wolfe. The first was administered electronically to a large agency (over 1,500 sworn) in the south. The second was administered through the mail to a stratified random sample of 2,496 municipal police chiefs. The response rates were 31% and 27%, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my motivations for administering these surveys was to revisit a subject I wrote about for my dissertation: the police legitimacy &amp;ldquo;dialogue&amp;rdquo; proposed by &lt;a href=&#34;https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&amp;amp;httpsredir=1&amp;amp;article=7419&amp;amp;context=jclc&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Anthony Bottoms and Justice Tankebe&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://jnix.netlify.app/img/legitimacy_dialogue.png&#34; alt=&#34;legitimacy_dialogue&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While a great deal of scholarhip has focused on citizens&amp;rsquo; perceptions of police legitimacy, comparatively less has considered how officers perceive their legitimacy in the eyes of the public, and what is associated with more/less of this perceived &amp;ldquo;audience legitimacy.&amp;rdquo; To date, I&amp;rsquo;ve published two &lt;a href=&#34;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0011128715620627&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;papers&lt;/a&gt; from my dissertation, which largely built on some of Tal Jonathan-Zamir&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://academic.oup.com/bjc/article-abstract/54/3/469/341017&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;work&lt;/a&gt; in Israel. Her work indicated commanding officers of the Israel National Police associate their audience legitimacy with their ability to deal with crime more so than procedural fairness. Similarly, I &lt;a href=&#34;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0011128715597696&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that executives in the US associate citizen cooperation with their crime-fighting effectiveness. At the same time, my work suggested officers perceive their audience legitimacy differently in high- and low-crime areas of their community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our Forthcoming Study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this new paper forthcoming at &lt;em&gt;Journal of Research in Crime and Delinquency&lt;/em&gt;, we found that the primary predictor of officers&amp;rsquo; perceived audience legitimacy was &amp;ldquo;citizen animus,&amp;rdquo; or how they believe citizens generally treat police officers. In other words, officers who felt citizens treat police unfairly and disrespectfully perceived lower levels of audience legitimacy. This is perhaps not surprising, but the effect of citizen animus on perceived audience legitimacy was observed while controlling for many other important variables, including various respondent demographics, media coverage of policing, violent crime rate, community racial composition, population, unemployment rate, and political climate. This matters because the dialogic model, along with empirical research accumulated to date, suggests perceived audience legitimacy can influence police self-legitimacy, and by extension, officer behaviors (e.g., &lt;a href=&#34;https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-09813-5_12&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;propensity to use force&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0093854818763230&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;treating citizens with procedural fairness&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bonus Finding&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Editor and peer reviewers provided us with valuable feedback that made the paper much stronger. One suggestion was to try to provide some evidence that our results weren&amp;rsquo;t being skewed by nonresponse bias. Recall our relatively low response rates - 31% and 27%. If respondents&amp;rsquo; willingness to participate in our surveys was associated with our outcome variable (perceived audience legitimacy), then our results could be biased. In other words, those who responded would be significantly different from those who did not in terms of perceived audience legitimacy, which would call into question the generalizability of our findings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to this suggestion, we simulated what would happen in both studies if nonrespondents would have scored 1-2 standard deviations below or above the observed mean of our dependent variable (i.e., the respondent group). In either scenario, it would mean that the propensity to respond was highly correlated with our outcome (r &amp;gt; |.50|). Yet, upon running 1,000 simulations for each study at these &amp;ldquo;negative bias&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;positive bias&amp;rdquo; thresholds, we arrived at substantively similar results (tabled in the Appendix).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Justin Pickett and I have written about the consequences of nonresponse to police surveys &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10439463.2017.1394300&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;before&lt;/a&gt;. He has also written about survey nonresponse more generally &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318214617_Methodological_Myths_and_the_Role_of_Appeals_in_Criminal_Justice_Journals_The_Case_of_Response_Rates&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3103018&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. We once had a paper rejected 8x before being published - where a common theme was that reviewers liked the paper, but couldn&amp;rsquo;t get past the 20% response rate (after 2+ years, it was finally &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/PIJPSM-09-2018-0133/full/html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Policing: An International Journal&lt;/em&gt;). Our hope is that the approach we took in this new paper will be useful to other researchers who are curious whether their low response rate amounts to a fatal flaw.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>That new study in PNAS on fatal officer-involved shootings</title>
      <link>https://jnix.netlify.app/post/post3-that-new-pnas-paper/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 30 Jul 2019 13:25:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://jnix.netlify.app/post/post3-that-new-pnas-paper/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A new study published in PNAS, titled &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2019/07/16/1903856116&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Officer characteristics and racial disparities in fatal officer-involved shootings&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; is getting lots of &lt;a href=&#34;https://pnas.altmetric.com/details/63894008/news&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;attention&lt;/a&gt; (34 news articles and tweeted by 1,808 users with an upper bound of 9.8 million followers as of 7/30/2019). It concludes, among other things, that &amp;ldquo;White officers are not more likely to shoot minoritiy civilians than non-White officers,&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Increasing diversity among officers by itself is unlikely to reduce racial disparity in police shootings.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/DrPhilGoff/status/1155916041924431872&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Others&lt;/a&gt; have been &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/jonmummolo/status/1153686295845244929&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;critical&lt;/a&gt; of the study, for good reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I commend the authors for being up front about a key limitation of their work: &amp;ldquo;Our analyses speak to racial disparities in the subset of shootings that result in fatalities, and not officers&amp;rsquo; decisions to use lethal force more generally.&amp;rdquo; But unfortunately, this gets lost in &lt;a href=&#34;https://abcnews.go.com/Health/fatal-police-shootings-race-officer-predictive-civilians-race/story?id=64563567&amp;amp;cid=clicksource_4380645_null_headlines_hed&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;media coverage&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/PoliceOne/status/1155914391973441536&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;tweets&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve &lt;a href=&#34;https://jnix.netlify.com/post/post2-fatality-rates/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; about this before. Fatal OIS are not a random sample of all OIS, so statistical analyses of them may serve to mislead us rather than shed light on the truth. Take a look at Table 2 on page 3 of their study:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://jnix.netlify.app/img/pnas_table2.png&#34; alt=&#34;pnas_table2&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The million dollar question here is: how often did each &amp;ldquo;variable&amp;rdquo; occur in 2015 when officers &lt;strong&gt;did not use deadly force&lt;/strong&gt;? As but one example, how often did police officers encounter suicidal civilians? In a &lt;em&gt;small subset&lt;/em&gt; of these incidents, officers fatally shot the suicidal citizen. That&amp;rsquo;s what is being analyzed in Table 2 for evidence of racial disparity. Not included in Table 2 are numerous incidents wherein the outcome was something other than a fatal OIS (e.g., nonfatal OIS, less lethal force, no force). Without knowing the racial breakdown of these counterfactual incidents, it isn&amp;rsquo;t possible to conclude anything about the &amp;ldquo;likelihood&amp;rdquo; of officers shooting minorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next month, at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://convention2.allacademic.com/one/asa/asa19/index.php?cmd=Online+Program+View+Session&amp;amp;selected_session_id=1479837&amp;amp;PHPSESSID=2b88b5bc2glse47gdg2iriajh5&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;ASA meeting&lt;/a&gt; in NYC, Geoff Alpert and I will be discussing the benefits and drawbacks of analyzing crowdsourced OIS data. Chief among the drawbacks is that most track only fatal OIS, and the racial breakdown of fatal OIS often differs substantially from the racial breakdown of &lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt; OIS. Here&amp;rsquo;s a table I made with the &lt;a href=&#34;https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/a3jjpa/nonfatal-police-shootings-data&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;VICE data&lt;/a&gt; I mentioned in my last post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://jnix.netlify.app/img/asa_comparison_table.png&#34; alt=&#34;asa_comparison_table&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among 21 jurisdictions with near complete data (&amp;lt; 5% missing) on the race of citizens shot by police from 2010-16, you can see that as you move from examining just fatalities to examining all OIS, %white decreases while %black increases. In some cities, the differences are more pronounced than others. Take Nashville, for example, where there were 39 OIS (only 11 of which were fatal):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://jnix.netlify.app/img/asa_nmpd.png&#34; alt=&#34;asa_nmpd&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this case, %white and %black basically flip from fatal OIS to all OIS. Perhaps the differences would be nonsignificant in a national database, but that remains unknown since no national database includes nonfatal OIS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We need to know about every time an officer shoots at a person, regardless of whether the person is killed.&lt;/strong&gt; We also need to know about the universe of incidents wherein it might have been reasonable for officers to use deadly force, but they &lt;a href=&#34;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0011128718756038&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;refrained from it&lt;/a&gt;. But as others have &lt;a href=&#34;https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3336338&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;pointed out&lt;/a&gt;, police administrative records are themselves biased if officers racially discriminate when choosing whom to investigate (the implication is we also need to know who they &lt;em&gt;don&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/em&gt; stop). There are no easy answers here. But for now, I see no reason why we can&amp;rsquo;t track nonfatal in addition to fatal OIS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The problems with OIS data that only capture fatalities</title>
      <link>https://jnix.netlify.app/post/post2-fatality-rates/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 23 Jun 2019 13:25:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://jnix.netlify.app/post/post2-fatality-rates/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the last few years, several websites that compile fatal officer-involved shooting (OIS) data have become available. These include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Washington Post&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2019/national/police-shootings-2019/?utm_term=.0968583ac95c&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Fatal Force&lt;/a&gt; data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://killedbypolice.net/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Killed By Police&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://fatalencounters.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Fatal Encounters&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mappingpoliceviolence.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Mapping Police Violence&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2015/jun/01/the-counted-police-killings-us-database&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;The Counted&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These databases are useful for answering some of the most basic questions about OIS. For example, a few years ago my colleagues and I &lt;a href=&#34;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0011128716686343&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;analyzed the Killed By Police data&lt;/a&gt; and found that fatal OIS have neither increased nor decreased significantly since the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, MO (despite claims to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://theundefeated.com/features/fatal-police-shootings-on-the-rise/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;contrary&lt;/a&gt;). More recently, we used The Washington Post&amp;rsquo;s data to discuss the strengths and weaknesses of various &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0735648X.2018.1547269&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;benchmarks&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; that can be used to make sense of racial disparities in fatal OIS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I worry gets lost on many people is that these data only capture &lt;em&gt;fatal&lt;/em&gt; OIS. But if an officer purposely discharges his/her firearm at a person, the officer has used deadly force &lt;em&gt;regardless of whether the person is killed&lt;/em&gt;. And in fact, OIS frequently do not result in death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 1980s, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07418828800089691&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;James Fyfe summarized seven studies&lt;/a&gt; that had analyzed OIS and found that fatality rates ranged from a low of 21% in Philadelphia (1975-78) to a high of 41.7% in Los Angeles (1974-78). A few years ago, &lt;a href=&#34;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1745-9133.12174&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;David Klinger and colleagues&lt;/a&gt; analyzed 10 years&amp;rsquo; worth of OIS by the St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department (2003-12), and found that 230 OIS resulted in 37 citizen fatalities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, VICE News compiled &lt;a href=&#34;https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/xwvv3a/shot-by-cops&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; on both fatal and nonfatal OIS in 47 of the largest 50 jurisdictions in the United States from 2010 to 2016. They documented 4,400 OIS - at least 1,382 of which were fatal (31.4%). Even if we assumed all of the 288 OIS with &amp;ldquo;unknown&amp;rdquo; outcomes were fatal, the overall fatality rate would increase only to about 38%. But the overall fatality rate, whatever it is, masks a ton of variation within this sample:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://jnix.netlify.app/img/vice_table.png&#34; alt=&#34;vice_table&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Focusing just on the jurisdictions with 100+ OIS, you can see that fatality rates during this time ranged from a low of 16.8% in St. Louis to 51.9% in Phoenix. Now consider some of the conclusions you might draw if you only had the &amp;ldquo;fatal&amp;rdquo; columns. You would probably conclude that police in Las Vegas shoot citizens over twice as often as police in St. Louis (47 v. 20). But the reality is that their OIS totals were virtually identical (115 v. 119). Similarly, while Boston and Atlanta each had 10 fatal OIS, Boston had just 4 additional nonfatal OIS, while Atlanta had an additional 32. And keep in mind these are just raw counts which don&amp;rsquo;t account for &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0735648X.2018.1547269&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;differences in population or violent crime rates&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many factors at play which likely influence whether an OIS results in a fatality, including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;type and caliber of gun used by officer(s)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;number of rounds fired&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;proximity to the nearest Level 1 &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsa052049&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Trauma Center&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;departmental policy on rendering aid&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if/how many bullets hit vital organs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This last factor can come down to centimeters, which is a big part of the reason why OIS data that only capture fatalities can be misleading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be clear, even complete data on fatal and nonfatal OIS (which Texas and a few other states are now &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0735648X.2018.1547353&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;collecting&lt;/a&gt;) would leave important questions unanswered. Ultimately, to make sense of patterns/trends in OIS, we need to be able to compare incidents that resulted in OIS to a comparable universe of incidents that did not result in OIS. As Andrew Wheeler and his colleagues &lt;a href=&#34;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1525107118759900&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;have demonstrated&lt;/a&gt;, we really need data on all instances in which officers draw and point their firearms, regardless of whether they ultimately shoot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our understanding of OIS has come a long way since Fyfe&amp;rsquo;s pioneering work in the 70s and 80s. But we&amp;rsquo;ve still got a long way to go.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Validity of details in databases logging police killings</title>
      <link>https://jnix.netlify.app/post/post1-the-lancet/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 18 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://jnix.netlify.app/post/post1-the-lancet/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(18)31130-9/fulltext&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published last year in The Lancet concluded that &amp;ldquo;police killings of unarmed black Americans have adverse effects on mental health among black American adults in the general population.&amp;rdquo; They used &lt;a href=&#34;https://mappingpoliceviolence.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Mapping Police Violence&lt;/a&gt; data, wherein individuals are coded as &amp;ldquo;unarmed&amp;rdquo; if they had a toy/replica gun or if they were &amp;ldquo;alleged to be armed by the police, but multiple independent witnesses maintain the person was unarmed.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are &lt;strong&gt;hugely&lt;/strong&gt; important caveats. Toy/replica guns can be nearly indistinguishable from actual guns, especially in a matter of split seconds. This is why similar databases compiled by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2019/national/police-shootings-2019/?utm_term=.ea6193d6288e&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/series/counted-us-police-killings&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt; are careful to label such incidents as involving toy/replica guns, rather than no weapon at all. Likewise, it is debatable whether we should dismiss police accounts of an incident simply because two or more witnesses disagree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One Saturday last summer, my colleague, &lt;a href=&#34;https://ww2.mc.vanderbilt.edu/physcifaculty/53075&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;James Lozada&lt;/a&gt;, and I decided to take a closer look at 110 fatal officer-involved shootings (OIS) that occurred from 2015 to 2017 involving a black citizen who MPV coded as &amp;ldquo;unarmed.&amp;rdquo; We focused specifically on OIS deaths because (1) these account for the vast majority of citizen fatalities at the hands of police, and (2) WAPO&amp;rsquo;s data do not include deaths by other means. Among these 110 OIS, &lt;strong&gt;36&lt;/strong&gt; involved individuals &lt;strong&gt;who were not unarmed&lt;/strong&gt; according to WAPO and The Guardian. Most had a toy/replica firearm, but four had an actual firearm, one had a knife, and three were undetermined according to WAPO:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://jnix.netlify.app/img/lancet_table.png&#34; alt=&#34;lancet_table&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Lancent published our &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS0140-6736(18)33043-5.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;written correspondence&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, though unfortunately, we were limited to 250 words. Our original submission was approximately 1,000 words and included tables that listed the discrepancies between MPV and WAPO/The Guardian.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our main takeaway was that the study&amp;rsquo;s conclusions may have been overstated, since MPV technically miscodes so many incidents each year. In fairness, the difference between an OIS involving someone who was &amp;ldquo;unarmed&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;holding/pointing something that looks like, but is not, an actual gun&amp;rdquo; may be irrelevant in terms of how the community views the incident after the fact. But the authors could have easily recoded these incidents and run sensitivity models to see if their substantive findings changed. At a minimum, researchers must be clear about these little, but critical, details.&lt;/p&gt;
