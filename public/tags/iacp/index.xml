      <description>&lt;p&gt;In 2014, the  Law Enforcement Advancing Data &amp;amp; Science (LEADS) Scholars Program was established through a partnership between the National Institute of Justice (NIJ) and the International Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP). The three-year program &amp;ldquo;aims to identify and nurture the next generation of law enforcement leadership through encouraging the use of evidence-based research to advance criminal justice.&amp;rdquo; By my count, 62 officers from around the US and Canada have gone through - or are currently participating in - the LEADS Scholars Program. This year, in addition to 12 &lt;em&gt;Scholars&lt;/em&gt;, LEADS also admitted two &lt;em&gt;Civilian Analysts&lt;/em&gt; and four &lt;em&gt;Academics&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;a href=&#34;https://nij.ojp.gov/bio/cory-haberman-0&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Cory Haberman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://nij.ojp.gov/bio/kyle-mclean&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Kyle McLean&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://nij.ojp.gov/bio/natalie-todak&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Natalie Todak&lt;/a&gt;, and me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our first order of business was to attend the 2019 IACP Conference in Chicago, which just ended yesterday. While there, I got to meet all of the current LEADS Scholars as well as a few alumni. We had a few roundtables where we discussed challenges and concerns surrounding the infusion of evidence into policing. We attended panels on recruitment/retention, social media, and pursuit policies. We sat in on IACP&amp;rsquo;s Research Advisory Committee meeting. We ate deep-dish pizza. But most importantly, we networked. I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to see where the program goes from here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The LEADS Scholars are truly an impressive bunch. You can read more about them, and the great work they&amp;rsquo;re doing in addition to their regular responsibilities, &lt;a href=&#34;https://nij.ojp.gov/topics/articles/law-enforcement-advancing-data-and-science-scholars-program&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
