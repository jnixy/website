      <title>Body-worn cameras and transparency: Experimental evidence of inconsistency in police executive decision-making</title>

      <description>&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUMMARY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Body-worn cameras (BWCs) have &lt;a href=&#34;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1098611120917937&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;rapidly diffused&lt;/a&gt; throughout US policing over the last decade. As of 2016, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/bwclea16.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;47 percent&lt;/a&gt; of all general-purpose law enforcement agencies had acquired BWCs. The general idea is that BWCs will increase transparency and accountability - and maybe even improve police-citizen interactions. The extant literature is rather mixed, but BWCs have consistently been shown to reduce complaints against officers.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Yet, a &lt;a href=&#34;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1745-9133.12412&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;recent meta review&lt;/a&gt; of 70 evaluation studies by Cynthia Lum and her colleagues concluded that &amp;ldquo;expectations and concerns surrounding BWCs among police leaders and citizens have not yet been realized by and large in the ways anticipated by each&amp;rdquo; (p. 93).&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing my coauthors and I have noticed is how inconsistent agencies seem to be about releasing footage of critical incidents (e.g., use of force incidents) to the public. According to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ncsl.org/research/civil-and-criminal-justice/body-worn-cameras-interactive-graphic.aspx#/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;National Conference of State Legislatures&lt;/a&gt;, 23 states and the District of Columbia have legislation pertaining to how BWC footage is addressed under open record laws. Yet even in those states, there are many exemptions that give police leaders the discretion to delay or withhold footage. To be sure, there may be legitimate reasons to do so (e.g., protecting victims or informants). But one thing seems clear: the public expects BWC footage of critical incidents to be released quickly. When it isn&amp;rsquo;t, agencies risk diminishing their legitimacy in the eyes of the public - many of whom might suspect they&amp;rsquo;re hiding something. Ironically, then, BWCs &lt;em&gt;reduce&lt;/em&gt; transparency if agencies have them but fail to release footage of critical incidents quickly.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For our new experimental study forthcoming in &lt;em&gt;Justice Quarterly&lt;/em&gt;, we presented a nationally representative sample&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; of police chiefs (N=476) with the following hypothetical vignette:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While on patrol, officers from your agency are dispatched to a home invasion in progress in a residential area. The caller describes the suspect as a [Black/white] male. One of your officers arrives on-scene and makes contact with a [Black/white] male who fits this description in front of the house. The suspect has his hands in his pockets and does not comply with your officer’s commands to show his hands. The suspect then quickly removes his hands from his pocket holding an object. Your officer fires at the suspect, killing him on the scene. Afterward, the officer finds that the object was a [handgun/cellphone]. The officer’s BWC captures full audio and video of the incident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that the suspect&amp;rsquo;s race was randomly assigned, as was the object he pulled from his pocket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We then asked the chiefs a series of questions about how they envisioned the aftermath of the shooting, including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How they believed the incident would be portrayed by the media&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How important they felt it would be to state publicly that the shooting was justified&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How important they personally felt it would be (regardless of law or policy) to release the footage quickly, make a statement to the media within 24 hours, keep the community updated on social media, and so on (see p. 9 of the post-print linked above)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For detailed results, download the full text. But the big picture takeaway is that chiefs&amp;rsquo; attitudes and decision-making were inconsistent. In addition to the suspect&amp;rsquo;s race and whether he was armed or unarmed, the size of responding chiefs&amp;rsquo; agencies (in terms of the number of sworn officers) seemed to affect their views about the incident. For example, chiefs in the smallest agencies seemed to think media coverage of the shooting would be similar regardless of whether the suspect had pulled a gun or a cellphone from his pocket. But in larger agencies - and particularly in the largest agencies - chiefs clearly felt media coverage would be more hostile if the object had been a cellphone:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://jnix.netlify.app/img/jq_bwcs_media.png&#34; alt=&#34;bwc_trans1&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So clearly something about agency size conditions the way executives view shootings like these, and how they respond to them when they&amp;rsquo;re recorded by BWCs. We were able to rule out urbanicity and violent crime (see Appendix E), but perhaps it has more to do with an agency&amp;rsquo;s recent history (or lack thereof) with critical incidents akin to the one we described (h/t to the peer reviewers for suggesting this supplemental analysis).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the broadest sense, our results suggest that legislation dictating when BWC footage must be released might be necessary. &lt;strong&gt;Details about an incident - such as whether the victim is Black or white, or whether he was armed or unarmed - should not influence whether the public gets to see the footage.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34;&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;It is unclear &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; they reduce complaints, however. Maybe they improve officer behavior, maybe citizens are less likely to file frivolous complaints, maybe a little bit of both.
 &lt;a class=&#34;footnote-return&#34; href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;^&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:2&#34;&gt;I believe this team also has a meta analysis of experimental and quasi-experimental evaluation studies forthcoming in &lt;em&gt;Campbell Systematic Reviews.&lt;/em&gt; 
 &lt;a class=&#34;footnote-return&#34; href=&#34;#fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;^&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:3&#34;&gt;As I write this, people are protesting in Rochester after BWC footage of Daniel Prude&amp;rsquo;s March 23rd arrest was just released (Prude wound up on life support and died 7 days later). Or consider the fatal shooting of Keith Lamont Scott in Charlotte. The incident was recorded by BWCs, but footage wasn&amp;rsquo;t released for 4 days. During that time, violent protests resulted in dozens of civilian injuries and one death. Or consider the altercation between an Alameda County sheriff&amp;rsquo;s deputy and Masai Ujiri (president of basketball operations for the Toronto Raptors) during the 2019 NBA finals. For whatever reason, BWC footage wasn&amp;rsquo;t made publicly available until over a year later, as a result of a countersuit Ujiri filed against the deputy. The footage &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/raptors/2020/08/18/new-video-officer-shoves-masai-ujiri-during-altercation-nba-finals/3398114001/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;seems to depict&lt;/a&gt; the deputy as the aggressor. 
 &lt;a class=&#34;footnote-return&#34; href=&#34;#fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;^&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:4&#34;&gt;We mailed surveys to a stratified random sample of 2,496 police chiefs. We stratified on agency size: 0-24, 25-49, 50-99, or 100+ full-time, sworn officers. We achieved a 27% response rate. But don&amp;rsquo;t get me started on whether that&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;good&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;bad.&amp;rdquo;
 &lt;a class=&#34;footnote-return&#34; href=&#34;#fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;^&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>New research: Police perceptions of their audience legitimacy</title>
      <link>https://jnix.netlify.app/post/post4-audience-legitimacy/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 15 Aug 2019 13:25:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://jnix.netlify.app/post/post4-audience-legitimacy/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year, I conducted two police surveys with the help of my colleagues Justin Pickett and Scott Wolfe. The first was administered electronically to a large agency (over 1,500 sworn) in the south. The second was administered through the mail to a stratified random sample of 2,496 municipal police chiefs. The response rates were 31% and 27%, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my motivations for administering these surveys was to revisit a subject I wrote about for my dissertation: the police legitimacy &amp;ldquo;dialogue&amp;rdquo; proposed by &lt;a href=&#34;https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&amp;amp;httpsredir=1&amp;amp;article=7419&amp;amp;context=jclc&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Anthony Bottoms and Justice Tankebe&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://jnix.netlify.app/img/legitimacy_dialogue.png&#34; alt=&#34;legitimacy_dialogue&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While a great deal of scholarhip has focused on citizens&amp;rsquo; perceptions of police legitimacy, comparatively less has considered how officers perceive their legitimacy in the eyes of the public, and what is associated with more/less of this perceived &amp;ldquo;audience legitimacy.&amp;rdquo; To date, I&amp;rsquo;ve published two &lt;a href=&#34;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0011128715620627&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;papers&lt;/a&gt; from my dissertation, which largely built on some of Tal Jonathan-Zamir&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://academic.oup.com/bjc/article-abstract/54/3/469/341017&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;work&lt;/a&gt; in Israel. Her work indicated commanding officers of the Israel National Police associate their audience legitimacy with their ability to deal with crime more so than procedural fairness. Similarly, I &lt;a href=&#34;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0011128715597696&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that executives in the US associate citizen cooperation with their crime-fighting effectiveness. At the same time, my work suggested officers perceive their audience legitimacy differently in high- and low-crime areas of their community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our Forthcoming Study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this new paper forthcoming at &lt;em&gt;Journal of Research in Crime and Delinquency&lt;/em&gt;, we found that the primary predictor of officers&amp;rsquo; perceived audience legitimacy was &amp;ldquo;citizen animus,&amp;rdquo; or how they believe citizens generally treat police officers. In other words, officers who felt citizens treat police unfairly and disrespectfully perceived lower levels of audience legitimacy. This is perhaps not surprising, but the effect of citizen animus on perceived audience legitimacy was observed while controlling for many other important variables, including various respondent demographics, media coverage of policing, violent crime rate, community racial composition, population, unemployment rate, and political climate. This matters because the dialogic model, along with empirical research accumulated to date, suggests perceived audience legitimacy can influence police self-legitimacy, and by extension, officer behaviors (e.g., &lt;a href=&#34;https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-09813-5_12&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;propensity to use force&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0093854818763230&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;treating citizens with procedural fairness&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bonus Finding&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Editor and peer reviewers provided us with valuable feedback that made the paper much stronger. One suggestion was to try to provide some evidence that our results weren&amp;rsquo;t being skewed by nonresponse bias. Recall our relatively low response rates - 31% and 27%. If respondents&amp;rsquo; willingness to participate in our surveys was associated with our outcome variable (perceived audience legitimacy), then our results could be biased. In other words, those who responded would be significantly different from those who did not in terms of perceived audience legitimacy, which would call into question the generalizability of our findings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to this suggestion, we simulated what would happen in both studies if nonrespondents would have scored 1-2 standard deviations below or above the observed mean of our dependent variable (i.e., the respondent group). In either scenario, it would mean that the propensity to respond was highly correlated with our outcome (r &amp;gt; |.50|). Yet, upon running 1,000 simulations for each study at these &amp;ldquo;negative bias&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;positive bias&amp;rdquo; thresholds, we arrived at substantively similar results (tabled in the Appendix).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Justin Pickett and I have written about the consequences of nonresponse to police surveys &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10439463.2017.1394300&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;before&lt;/a&gt;. He has also written about survey nonresponse more generally &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318214617_Methodological_Myths_and_the_Role_of_Appeals_in_Criminal_Justice_Journals_The_Case_of_Response_Rates&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3103018&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. We once had a paper rejected 8x before being published - where a common theme was that reviewers liked the paper, but couldn&amp;rsquo;t get past the 20% response rate (after 2+ years, it was finally &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/PIJPSM-09-2018-0133/full/html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Policing: An International Journal&lt;/em&gt;). Our hope is that the approach we took in this new paper will be useful to other researchers who are curious whether their low response rate amounts to a fatal flaw.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, feel free to contact me if you would like a copy of the paper.&lt;/p&gt;
