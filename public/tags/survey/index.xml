      <title>Now in print: Three experiments concerned with the Demeanor Hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://jnix.netlify.app/post/post7-demeanor/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 04 Dec 2019 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In a new paper published in &lt;em&gt;Journal of Experimental Criminology&lt;/em&gt;, my colleagues and I revisit the Demeanor Hypothesis, which holds that police officers respond more punitively to citizens who disrespect them or challenge their authority. In the 1990s, David Klinger argued that prior work had often conflated demeanor with criminal conduct. Based on his &lt;a href=&#34;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1745-9125.1994.tb01162.x&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; of police-citizen encounters in Dade County in the 1980s, he concluded &amp;ldquo;displays of hostility which violate no laws do not increase the likelihood of arrest in and of themselves.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we outline on p. 616 of our new paper, it is difficult to draw conclusions about the causal effects of demeanor based on studies that use systematic social observation (i.e., researchers observe police-citizen encounters and code things like demeanor, use of coercion by officers, etc.) for several reasons. As one example, if a citizen&amp;rsquo;s behavior could be categorized as both disrespectful &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; noncompliant, how can we know which is influencing the officer&amp;rsquo;s decision making? We shouldn&amp;rsquo;t just assume post-hoc that the officer&amp;rsquo;s response was prompted by the citizen&amp;rsquo;s noncompliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our paper, we tested whether citizen disrespect heightens officers&amp;rsquo; suspicion and perceived danger, or causes them to feel more angry, frustrated, annoyed, or fearful. To do this, we presented 546 officers in a large southwestern agency with vignettes about routine police-citizen interactions (public order violation, traffic stop, suspicious person call) wherein the citizen&amp;rsquo;s demeanor was randomized (compliant, &lt;em&gt;bad attitude&lt;/em&gt;, or noncompliant). Importantly, the citizen with a &lt;em&gt;bad attitude&lt;/em&gt; obeyed the officer&amp;rsquo;s commands but did so in a disrespectful way (e.g., shouting, using profanity, calling the officer names, mocking the officer). This experimental design allowed us to isolate the effect of demeanor on officers&amp;rsquo; cognitive and emotional responses, which we expect to influence their behavioral responses, based on experimental evidence published in the field of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.lawsocsci.4.110707.172335&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;moral psychology&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across each experiment, we found that disrespect &lt;em&gt;in and of itself&lt;/em&gt; triggered suspicion, annoyance, and frustration among officers. In the suspicious person experiment, disrespect also caused officers to perceive the citizen as more dangerous. The next step, of course, is to determine whether these cognitions and emotions do in fact increase the likelihood of punitive behavioral responses by officers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For detailed results, &lt;strong&gt;you can download our article for free &lt;a href=&#34;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11292-019-09363-4&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (see pp. 626-27). Here&amp;rsquo;s a figure that nicely summarizes our findings:&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;At ASC this year, I am participating in a &lt;a href=&#34;https://convention2.allacademic.com/one/asc/asc19/index.php?cmd=Online+Program+View+Session&amp;amp;selected_session_id=1538326&amp;amp;PHPSESSID=c56c4c6v1anm30a115i2rukmt3&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;thematic panel&lt;/a&gt; organized by &lt;a href=&#34;https://research-portal.uws.ac.uk/en/persons/ross-deuchar&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Ross Deuchar&lt;/a&gt; of the University of the West of Scotland. The theme is &amp;ldquo;International Perspectives on Policing Communities, Procedural Justice and Legitimacy.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My paper (with Natalie Todak and Brandon Tregle) explores the factors associated with the adoption of body-worn cameras, using survey data from a national sample of municipal police departments. We also examine variation in police executives&amp;rsquo; perceived importance of being transparent with their communities about things such as allegations of officer misconduct, use of force incidents, and changes in police tactics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other presenters include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

      <title>Testing a Theoretical Model of Perceived Audience Legitimacy: The Neglected Linkage in the Dialogic Model of Policeâ€“community Relations</title>

      <title>New research: Police perceptions of their audience legitimacy</title>
      <link>https://jnix.netlify.app/post/post4-audience-legitimacy/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 15 Aug 2019 13:25:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://jnix.netlify.app/post/post4-audience-legitimacy/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year, I conducted two police surveys with the help of my colleagues Justin Pickett and Scott Wolfe. The first was administered electronically to a large agency (over 1,500 sworn) in the south. The second was administered through the mail to a stratified random sample of 2,496 municipal police chiefs. The response rates were 31% and 27%, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my motivations for administering these surveys was to revisit a subject I wrote about for my dissertation: the police legitimacy &amp;ldquo;dialogue&amp;rdquo; proposed by &lt;a href=&#34;https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&amp;amp;httpsredir=1&amp;amp;article=7419&amp;amp;context=jclc&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Anthony Bottoms and Justice Tankebe&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://jnix.netlify.app/img/legitimacy_dialogue.png&#34; alt=&#34;legitimacy_dialogue&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While a great deal of scholarhip has focused on citizens&amp;rsquo; perceptions of police legitimacy, comparatively less has considered how officers perceive their legitimacy in the eyes of the public, and what is associated with more/less of this perceived &amp;ldquo;audience legitimacy.&amp;rdquo; To date, I&amp;rsquo;ve published two &lt;a href=&#34;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0011128715620627&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;papers&lt;/a&gt; from my dissertation, which largely built on some of Tal Jonathan-Zamir&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://academic.oup.com/bjc/article-abstract/54/3/469/341017&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;work&lt;/a&gt; in Israel. Her work indicated commanding officers of the Israel National Police associate their audience legitimacy with their ability to deal with crime more so than procedural fairness. Similarly, I &lt;a href=&#34;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0011128715597696&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that executives in the US associate citizen cooperation with their crime-fighting effectiveness. At the same time, my work suggested officers perceive their audience legitimacy differently in high- and low-crime areas of their community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our Forthcoming Study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this new paper forthcoming at &lt;em&gt;Journal of Research in Crime and Delinquency&lt;/em&gt;, we found that the primary predictor of officers&amp;rsquo; perceived audience legitimacy was &amp;ldquo;citizen animus,&amp;rdquo; or how they believe citizens generally treat police officers. In other words, officers who felt citizens treat police unfairly and disrespectfully perceived lower levels of audience legitimacy. This is perhaps not surprising, but the effect of citizen animus on perceived audience legitimacy was observed while controlling for many other important variables, including various respondent demographics, media coverage of policing, violent crime rate, community racial composition, population, unemployment rate, and political climate. This matters because the dialogic model, along with empirical research accumulated to date, suggests perceived audience legitimacy can influence police self-legitimacy, and by extension, officer behaviors (e.g., &lt;a href=&#34;https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-09813-5_12&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;propensity to use force&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0093854818763230&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;treating citizens with procedural fairness&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bonus Finding&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Editor and peer reviewers provided us with valuable feedback that made the paper much stronger. One suggestion was to try to provide some evidence that our results weren&amp;rsquo;t being skewed by nonresponse bias. Recall our relatively low response rates - 31% and 27%. If respondents&amp;rsquo; willingness to participate in our surveys was associated with our outcome variable (perceived audience legitimacy), then our results could be biased. In other words, those who responded would be significantly different from those who did not in terms of perceived audience legitimacy, which would call into question the generalizability of our findings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to this suggestion, we simulated what would happen in both studies if nonrespondents would have scored 1-2 standard deviations below or above the observed mean of our dependent variable (i.e., the respondent group). In either scenario, it would mean that the propensity to respond was highly correlated with our outcome (r &amp;gt; |.50|). Yet, upon running 1,000 simulations for each study at these &amp;ldquo;negative bias&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;positive bias&amp;rdquo; thresholds, we arrived at substantively similar results (tabled in the Appendix).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Justin Pickett and I have written about the consequences of nonresponse to police surveys &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10439463.2017.1394300&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;before&lt;/a&gt;. He has also written about survey nonresponse more generally &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318214617_Methodological_Myths_and_the_Role_of_Appeals_in_Criminal_Justice_Journals_The_Case_of_Response_Rates&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3103018&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. We once had a paper rejected 8x before being published - where a common theme was that reviewers liked the paper, but couldn&amp;rsquo;t get past the 20% response rate (after 2+ years, it was finally &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/PIJPSM-09-2018-0133/full/html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Policing: An International Journal&lt;/em&gt;). Our hope is that the approach we took in this new paper will be useful to other researchers who are curious whether their low response rate amounts to a fatal flaw.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, feel free to contact me if you would like a copy of the paper.&lt;/p&gt;
