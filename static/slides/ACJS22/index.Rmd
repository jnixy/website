# Background 

--

**March 2020**: COVID-19 stay-at-home orders issued

--

**May 2020**: Police kill George Floyd in Minneapolis

--

- Sparked the [largest protest movement](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/07/03/us/george-floyd-protests-crowd-size.html) in U.S. history

> *Further racialize[d] and politicize[d] attitudes within the domain of race and law enforcement in the U.S.*

<div style="text-align: right"> - Reny & Newman (2021) </div>

- Calls to "defund" and "abolish" the police
  
--

By year's end, homicides had spiked in the U.S. [by nearly 30%](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/10/27/what-we-know-about-the-increase-in-u-s-murders-in-2020/)

---

# Background 

--

**Feb 2021**: We wrote about city-level trends for [The Denver Post](https://www.denverpost.com/2021/02/24/denver-crime-rate-homicide-shooting-property-crime-police/)

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width = "80%"}

```

# Purpose

--

To examine the relationship between police discretionary behaviors and crime at the neighborhood level

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width = "70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("nhoods.jpg")
```

---

# Data

- Crime, vehicle and pedestrian stops, and traffic collisions (from [Police Data Initiative](https://www.denvergov.org/opendata/search?q=police))

--

- Drug-related arrests (requested from [DPD](https://www.denvergov.org/Government/Agencies-Departments-Offices/Agencies-Departments-Offices-Directory/Police-Department))

--

- [Open Table Reservations](https://www.opentable.com/state-of-industry)

--

- Precipitation and Temperature (from [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datasets))

--

- Air Quality Index (from [Environmental Protection Agency](https://www.epa.gov/outdoor-air-quality-data/download-daily-data))

--

- Concentrated Disadvantage (from [ACS](https://www.denvergov.org/opendata/dataset/american-community-survey-nbrhd-2015-2019))

# Data

--

Unit of analysis üëâ **neighborhood weeks**

- 78 neighborhoods nested within 52 weeks (N x T = 4,056)

--

For each week of 2020, each variable is coded as the deviation from the **weighted 3-week average** 

--

- 2020 split into three periods: 

  - pre-COVID (weeks 1-10)
  - COVID Shock (weeks 11-21)
  - Floyd Shock (weeks 22-52)

--

**Outcomes** üëâ *violent* and *property* crime

# Next Steps

--

What happens to crime rates when police suddenly *make fewer proactive stops and arrests* for a sustained period?

--

We've requested but are still waiting on COVID test data

--

Plan to run multi-level multivariable models that regress crime outcomes onto:

- *Time variant factors*
  - Police discretionary behaviors
  - Weather
  - Air Quality
  - Public movement
  - Reckless driving
  
- *Time stable factors*
  - Concentrated disadvantage

# Limitations

Just one city

--

Don't know precisely what caused the reduction in discretionary stops and arrests

--

  - Calculated decision-making by officers?
  
  - Patrol officers having to work protests?
  
  - Reduction in sworn capacity brought on by COVID or resignations? (e.g., [Mourtgos et al. 2022](https://jnix.netlify.app/files/pdfs/cpp_turnover.pdf))
  
--

Can't speak to variation within neighborhoods (e.g., street segments, see [Connealy 2021](https://www.proquest.com/docview/2542373679?pq-origsite=gscholar&fromopenview=true))

# Implications

The national homicide rate increased again in 2021, and [remains elevated in 2022](https://www.ahdatalytics.com/dashboards/ytd-murder-comparison/)

--

Studies like ours hope to contribute to a broader conversation about the appropriate role of police in our society

--

- How should police allocate their limited resources? ([Wheeler 2020](https://doi.org/10.1080/07418825.2019.1630471))

--

- In terms of maximizing public safety while minimizing police-caused harms...

  - What is the *optimal* rate of stopping (or arresting) people? ([Weisburst 2022](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yYwJ9Kl1eJHdAD8HH9HVB8QFTvkb1Sov/view))
