# Background 

--

- [WAPO](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/investigations/police-shootings-database/), [Fatal Encounters](www.fatalencounters.org), and [MPV](www.mappingpoliceviolence.org) have given us a better idea how often police kill people in the United States

--

- *Lots* of researchers have used these data to answer *lots* of research questions<sup>[1-4]</sup>

--

- But deaths caused by police officers are just one outcome of the behavior we're really interested in: the **use of** lethal force

--

- Lethal force is "physical force *capable of or likely to kill*...it does not always kill"<sup>[5]</sup>

--

- **Every time** police officers shoot at a person, they're using lethal force - even if they don't ultimately kill the person

# Purpose

--

To demonstrate how existing data may be misleading us

--

1. Quantify nonfatal, injurious police shootings of people in four states with sufficient data

--

2. Examine the factors associated with mortality, conditional on being shot by a police officer

# Data

Police shooting data from four states:

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width = "550px"}
knitr::include_graphics("map.png")
```

Level I and II Adult Trauma Centers

- Pulled from Trauma Center Association of America [website](https://www.traumacenters.org/page/TraumaCentersMap)

# Data

**Dependent Variable**: Fatality (1 = yes; 0 = nonfatal injury)

--

**Covariates**

--

- Race/Ethnicity (White, Black, Hispanic, Other)

- Sex (Male = 1)

- Age (25 and under, 26-35, 36-45, 45 and older)

--

- Deadly Weapon (1 = yes)

--

- Trauma Center (1 = 1+ in the county)

- Metropolitan County (1 = yes)

# Implications

**Recap**

--

- 45% of the victims in this sample **did not die**

--

- Black and younger victims less likely to die (conditional on being shot)

--

- Victims armed with deadly weapons were ~16% more likely to die (conditional on being shot)

--

**So what?**

--

- The federal government has consistently failed to compile these data

--

- More states should follow the lead of Texas, California, New Jersey, Connecticut, and Maine

--

- Researchers: Be careful about generalizing from data that only capture fatalities
