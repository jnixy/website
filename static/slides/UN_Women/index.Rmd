# Background 

- DV-related calls for service to police increased directly after stay-at-home orders<sup>[1]</sup>

--

- Most DV victims **do not call police** after incidents of partner violence<sup>[2]</sup>

--

- Victims may seek out help from victim service organizations, commonly through an emergency DV hotline<sup>[3]</sup>

--

- Victim calls to *emergency DV hotlines* may provide important information on DV trends during COVID-19.

---

# Purpose

- Examine the **observed trend** in DV calls for service to police and emergency hotlines before and during COVID-19.

--

- Estimate the **expected trend** (i.e., counterfactual) in DV calls for service to police and emergency hotlines during COVID-19.

--

- Compare **differences** in the observed and expected trends for DV calls for service to police and emergency hotlines during COVID-19.

class: top

# Data

- Seven U.S. cities: Baltimore, MD; Cincinnati, OH; Hartford, CT; Orlando, FL; Sacramento, CA; Salt Lake City, UT; and St. Petersburg, FL.

--

- Police calls were obtained from the [Police Data Initiative](https://www.policedatainitiative.org/datasets/calls-for-service/).

--

- Emergency hotline calls were obtained directly from the victim service agencies.

--

- Study period: January 1, 2018 to October 31, 2020; COVID-related period: March 9 to October 31, 2020<sup>[4]</sup>

# Analyses

- **Observed Trend** - Bayesian Structural Time Series (BSTS) models are estimated for police calls for service (CFS) and emergency hotline calls (EHC) in each city using 2018 and 2019 data (i.e., non-COVID period).

--

- **Expected Trend** - BSTS models are then used to estimate a counterfactual for CFS and EHC in each jurisdiction between March 9 and October 31, 2020 (i.e., COVID period).

--

- **Differences** - mean differences between the observed and expected trends are calculated for the COVID period, providing estimates of the impact on CFS and EHC in each jurisdiction.

# Findings: Calls for Police Service

.pull-left[
![fig1_ehc](un_women_fig1.jpg)
]

.pull-right[
- Increases in police calls were observed in Baltimore, Sacramento, and Salt Lake City. 
- Increases ranged from 1.64 more calls per day on average to 7.16 more calls per day on average, for **a total of 1030.32 more calls to police** from March 9 to October 31, 2020.

# Findings: Emergency Hotline Calls

.pull-left[
![fig2_ehc](un_women_fig2.jpg)
]

.pull-right[
- Increases in the average number of calls to emergency hotlines were observed for Baltimore, Cincinnati, Hartford, Salt Lake City, and St. Petersburg. 
- These increases ranged from 2.31 more calls per day on average to 4.64 more calls per day on average, for **a total of 1670.85 more calls to emergency hotlines** from March 9 to October 31, 2020.

# Findings: Comparisons

- General increases in calls for DV service, but variation across cities in whether increases in calls to police, emergency hotlines, or both.
- Sacramento experienced an increase in calls to **police only** while Cincinnati, Hartford, and St. Petersburg experienced increases in calls to **emergency hotlines only.**
- Baltimore and Salt Lake City experienced an increase in calls to **both** police and emergency hotlines.
- Orlando experienced a decrease in calls to **both** police and emergency hotlines.

# Discussion

- Police calls only tell us part of the story about DV help seeking during COVID-19.

--

- Emergency hotlines/advocates shouldered a significant burden.

--

- Critical to understand local effects, localized impacts on agencies.

--

- As COVID recedes, we cannot forget about the “pandemic within the pandemic” - ongoing economic stressors associated with DV are not easily/quickly solved.

---

# Implications

Can we develop a culture of better data sharing and usage within/across criminal justice and victim service agencies?
- Better understand localized trends, deploy training and resources in real time.

--

Can strategic research-practitioner partnerships help domestic violence coordinated community response teams?
- Data-driven decisions regarding local prevention and intervention (e.g., pop-up advocacy sites, well-checks for DV “hotspots”).
