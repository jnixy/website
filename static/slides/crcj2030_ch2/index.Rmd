- Democracy = "Rule by the people"

--

- Policing in a democracy = *by consent*

--

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width = "35%"}

# Policing in a Democracy

--

- The US is a *representative democracy*

--

- Adheres to [federalism](https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/learning-material/federalism)

--

  - A union of self-governing states
  
--

  - Dual federalism
  
--

  - But see *Supremacy Clause* [(Article VI, paragraph 2)](https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/interpretation/article-vi/clauses/31)
  
--

  - US is more of a *cooperative federalism*
  
--

- This structure defines the three *levels* of US policing

--

  - Federal, state, and local
  
--

Why not have a single, centralized police force?

  - Not a monolith
