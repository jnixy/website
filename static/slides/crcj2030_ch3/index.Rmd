# State Law Enforcement

## Centralized Model

  - E.G., [Nebraska State Patrol](https://statepatrol.nebraska.gov/)
  
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width = "50%", fig.cap = "(Photo by Trooper Clint Zost)"}
knitr::include_graphics("nsp_tornado.jpg")
```
  
---
class: top

# State Law Enforcement

--

## Decentralized Model

--

- Clearer distinction between *highway safety* and *other state-level functions*

--

  - E.G., [Department of Public Safety](https://scdps.sc.gov/) and [SLED](https://www.sled.sc.gov/) in South Carolina

---
class: top

# Local Policing

--

- Decentralized and fragmented

--

  - E.G., there are **227** local law enforcement agencies [in Nebraska](https://www.nebraska.gov/crime_commission/directory/index.cgi)

--

      - Including **9** in Douglas County alone

## Municipal Police

--

  - Authorized, funded, and operated within the limits of own jurisdictions
  
--

  - Each jurisdiction has its own goals and policies
  
--

- Most employ [fewer than 25 officers](https://bjs.ojp.gov/content/pub/pdf/lpd16p.pdf)

# Police Organizations

--

- Highly bureaucratized

--

  - See for example [OPD](https://public.powerdms.com/OPDEP1/tree/documents/2547925) and [LAPD](https://lapdonlinestrgeacc.blob.core.usgovcloudapi.net/lapdonlinemedia/2021/12/Org_chart_DP12_11232021.pdf) organizational charts...
  
--

- Different from private organizations:

--

  - Exist within political environments
  
--
  
  - Not for profit
  
--

  - Rules and regulations often limit creativity and flexibility

# Police Organizations

--

## Staff vs. Line Duties

---
class: top

# Police Organizations

## Staff vs. Line Duties

--

### Sworn Personnel

--

- All the commissioned peace officers within the organization

--

- From chief or sheriff down to front-line officers or deputies

--

- Wide range of responsibilities (recall our discussion from [Week 1](https://jnix.netlify.app/slides/crcj2030_first_day/#14))

---
class: top

# Police Organizations

--

- Sir Robert Peel advocated for a military structure

--

  - In the US, our agencies often referred to as *quasi-military*

--

- **Frederick Taylor**, *Scientific Management Theory*
  
--

- **Max Weber**, *Bureaucratic Theory*

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width = "20%", fig.cap = "(Hacerahsen, CC BY-SA 4.0, via Wikimedia Commons)"}

```

  
--

- ***What do you think of structuring organizations this way?***

---
class: top

# Police Organizations

--

- **Contemporary organizational theory**

--

  - Line-level officers should have some say in decision-making and planning
  
  - i.e., *participatory management*
  
--

  - ***Why?***
  
--

- **Contingency theory**

--

  - Recognizes the difference between *repetitive* and *non-repetitive* tasks
