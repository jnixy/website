# Sources of Police Subculture

--

## Organizational factors

--

- Starts with basic and field training

--

- Colleagues working the same shifts and beats

--

  - [Klinger (1997)](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-9125.1997.tb00877.x): "territorially based independent work groups"
  
  - See also [Ingram et al. (2018)](https://doi.org/10.1111/1745-9125.12192)

# Sources of Police Subculture

--

## The Street

--

- Interactions with citizens

--

  - People who have criminally offended and been victimized
  
--

  - Can result in stereotyping, [illusory correlations](https://doi.org/10.1177%2F0093854807304484)
  
--

      - E.G., "all people of Group X are dangerous" or "most people in this neighborhood are up to no good"
      
--
  
  - Can also lead to a sense of helplessness

## The Media

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width = "35%"}
knitr::include_graphics("breaking_news.png")
```

--

Your textbook says the media has the most influence on police subculture...

--

  - ***Do you agree or disagree?***
  
--

  - See the so-called [Ferguson Effect](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3715223)

# Sources of Police Subculture

--

## Other Criminal Justice System Entities

--

- Prosecutors and judges

  - E.G., newly elected Manhattan D.A. Alvin Bragg [recently announced](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/08/nyregion/alvin-bragg-police-chief-eric-adams.html) a policy to "avoid seeking jail or prison time for all but the most serious crimes, and to cease charging a number of lower level crimes"
  
--

      - ***Regardless what you think of the policy, how might this affect police subculture?***

# Components of Police Subculture

> Policing in the United States is very much like going to war. Three times a day in countless locker rooms across the land, large men and a growing number of women carefully arm and armor themselves for the dayâ€™s events. They begin by strapping on flak jacketsâ€¦Then they pick up a wide, heavy, black leather belt and hang around it the tools of their trade: gun, mace, handcuffs, bullets. When it is fully loaded, they swing the belt around their hips with the same practiced motion of the gun-fighter in Western movies, slugging it down and buckling it in front. Many officers slip an additional small-caliber pistol into their trouser pocket or a leg holster just above the ankle. Inspecting themselves in a full-length mirror, officers thread their night sticks into a metal ring on the side of their belt.

> I guess what our job really boils down to is not letting the assholes take over the city...What I'm talking about are those shitheads out to prove they can push everybody around. Those are the assholes we gotta deal with and take care of on patrol...They're the ones that make it tough on the decent people out there. You take the majority of what we do and its nothing more than asshole control.
