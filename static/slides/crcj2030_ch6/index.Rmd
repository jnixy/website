# Discretion

--

- The freedom to act according to one's own judgment and conscience

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width = "30%"}
knitr::include_graphics("choices.png")
```

--

- Exists in all phases of the criminal justice system

--

  - Stops and arrests, prosecution, sentencing, probation and parole
  
--

- What potential *benefits* does discretion offer?

--

- What potential *drawbacks* does it involve?

# Why is it Necessary?

--

- *Total enforcement* is impossible

--

  - *Full enforcement* possible [in theory](https://www.jstor.org/stable/973838), but we know that police often decide *not to enforce*
  
--

  - This leaves us with *actual enforcement* - the "area" of which shrinks as we advance through the stages of the CJ process
  
--

- Officers' decisions whether to invoke the criminal process "largely determine the outer limits of law enforcement" [(Goldstein, 1960:543)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/794445)

# The Decision to Enforce

--

- Discretion consists of two parts:

--

  1. *Whether* to intervene

  2. *How* to intervene
  
--

- Consider how officers used their discretion in [this incident](https://www.cnn.com/2014/03/04/us/court-police-chase/index.html)

--

- Think of it like an incredibly high-stakes game of [blackjack](https://www.police1.com/police-products/pursuit-management-technology/articles/16-to-a-dealers-10-could-blackjack-odds-help-inform-police-pursuit-policies-Y9x2Avr8SWzJG1c4/)

# Seven factors that influence the use of discretion

--

1. [Nature](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-9125.1997.tb00877.x) of the crime or problem

--

2. [Neighborhood context](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcrimjus.2021.101829)

--

3. [Relational distance](https://doi.org/10.1177%2F0011128711420102) between offender and victim

--

4. [Demeanor](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11292-019-09363-4)

--

5. Demographics of the [offender](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-9125.2011.00230.x) or victim

6. [Departmental policy](https://doi.org/10.1080/07418825.2016.1147593)

# Classic Studies of Police Discretion

--

William Westley: [Violence and the Police](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/221264)

--

As part of his dissertation fieldwork in the late 1940s, Westley asked officers in Gary, Indiana: 

--

> When do you think a policeman is justified in roughing a man up?

--

| Type of Response            | Frequency | Percentage |
|:----------------------------|----------:|-----------:|
| Disrespect for police       |        27 |         37 |
| When impossible to avoid    |        17 |         23 |
| To obtain information       |        14 |         19 |
| To make an arrest           |         6 |          8 |
| For the hardened criminal   |         5 |          7 |
| When you know man is guilty |         2 |          3 |
| For sex criminals           |         2 |          3 |
|                   **Total** |        73 |        100 |

# Media Coverage and Police Behavior

***How might the media have an effect on...***

--

- Police behavior?

--

- Crime?

--

- Clearance rates?

  - What did Drs. Mastrorocco and Ornaghi find in [their study](https://ariannaornaghi.github.io/ariannaornaghi.com/who_watches_the_watchmen.pdf)?
