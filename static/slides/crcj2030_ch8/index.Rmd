- Recommends "experimentation with a [team policing](https://www.ojp.gov/pdffiles1/11430.pdf) concept" (see [page 118 of the final report](https://www.ojp.gov/pdffiles1/Digitization/42NCJRS.pdf))

# The Path to Community Policing

## 1970s

--

A pair of studies cast doubt on effectiveness of the traditional "law enforcement" role:

--

- National Police Foundation's [Kansas City Patrol Experiment](https://www.policefoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Kelling-et-al.-1974-THE-KANSAS-CITY-PREVENTIVE-PATROL-EXPERIMENT.pdf)
  
--

- Rand Corporation's [report](https://www.ojp.gov/pdffiles1/Digitization/44810NCJRS.pdf) on the criminal investigation process
  
--

Soon after, police in [Flint, MI](https://www.ojp.gov/ncjrs/virtual-library/abstracts/evaluation-neighborhood-foot-patrol-program-flint-michigan) and [Newark, NJ](https://www.policefoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/144273499-The-Newark-Foot-Patrol-Experiment.pdf) launch foot patrol programs

# How prevalent is "Community Policing" today?

| Population Served   | Has a written COP plan |
|---------------------|:----------------------:|
| 1 million+          |           80%          |
| 500,000-999,999     |           72%          |
| 250,000-499,999     |           78%          |

# Assessing the Evidence

--

Charlotte Gill et al.'s [meta-analysis](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11292-014-9210-y) of 37 studies suggests community policing:

--

- Increases satisfaction and perceived legitimacy of police
  
--
  
- Improves perceptions of disorder
  
--

- However, it has "limited effects on crime and fear of crime"
  
---
class: top

# Assessing the Evidence

--

Results of Kyle Peyton et al.'s [field experiment](https://www.pnas.org/content/116/40/19894) in New Haven were promising

--

- Brief door-to-door non-enforcement visits ðŸ‘‰ improved attitudes as much as 21 days later

--

*In theory*, these short-term gains in trust/legitimacy could contribute to long-term crime reduction benefits

--

- But methodologically rigorous evidence is scant

---
class: top

# Assessing the Evidence

--

Foot patrol seems to work well

--

- See, e.g., studies in [Philadelphia](https://www.jratcliffe.net/phila-foot-patrol-experiment) and [Dayton](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/329564228_The_Dayton_Foot_Patrol_Program_An_Evaluation_of_Hot_Spots_Foot_Patrols_in_a_Central_Business_District)
  
--

[POP approaches](https://popcenter.asu.edu/) also have a promising evidence base

--

- [Meta analysis](https://doi.org/10.1002/cl2.1089) of 34 studies ðŸ‘‰ 33.8% reduction in crime/disorder in treatment areas/groups
  
--

  - And no significant displacement effects

# Key Challenges

--

## Implementation

--

Buy-in / commitment 

--

- From officers and the community

--

## Evaluation

--

Measurement

--

  - What did the agency do?
  
--

  - Ruling out alternative explanations
