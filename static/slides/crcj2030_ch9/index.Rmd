--

2. Policy and oversight

--

3. Technology and social media

--

4. Community policing and crime reduction

--

5. Training and education

--

6. Officer wellness and safety

## 1. Building trust and legitimacy

--

- Treating people with dignity and respect

--

- Giving people a "voice" during encounters

--

- Being neutral and transparent in decision making

--

- Conveying trustworthy motives

--

Diversify departments to reflect the demographics of their communities

# A Legitimacy Crisis Renewed

Popular theories:

- [De-policing, decreased trust, and emboldened offenders](https://www.denverpost.com/2021/02/24/denver-crime-rate-homicide-shooting-property-crime-police/)

--

- [Increase in gun carrying](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/01/gun-sales-murder-spike/621196/)

Thomas Abt argues police are [necessary but not sufficient](https://www.policechiefmagazine.org/necessary-but-not-sufficient/?ref=e6b395be13bf27a03cf9a63a7c18aced) to address the ongoing wave of violence

And as Aaron Chalfin et al. show üëâ [when cities add cops, Black residents could have the most to gain ‚Äî and the most to lose](https://www.niskanencenter.org/when-cities-add-cops-black-residents-could-have-the-most-to-gain-and-the-most-to-lose/)
