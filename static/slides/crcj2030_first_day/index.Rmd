# Pop Quiz!

--

Take out a sheet of paper and write down your answers to the following:

--

1. **In one sentence**, explain why we have police (i.e., what is their **purpose**?).

2. What does **violent crime** refer to?

3. On any given day, about what % of their time do police spend responding to violent crime?

4. For every 1,000 crimes, how many do you think result in an offender going to jail or prison?

5. What gives Americans **confidence** in the police?

6. Has policing has become **more dangerous** in the last 30 years?

# The function of police in society

--

If we want to reform the police, [the first step](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/06/first-step-figuring-out-what-police-are/612793/) is figuring out what they're for.

--

- Sociologist **Egon Bittner** famously said:

> [Police are nothing else than a mechanism for the distribution of situationally justified force in society.](https://www.ojp.gov/pdffiles1/Digitization/147822NCJRS.pdf)

--

- So we must ask ourselves: 

> [What kinds of situations require remedies that are non-negotiably coercible?](https://www.ojp.gov/pdffiles1/Digitization/147822NCJRS.pdf)

  - ***Do you agree?***

# How **Dangerous** is Policing?

--

- Line-of-duty deaths have declined dramatically [since the 1970s](https://doi.org/10.1111/1745-9133.12408)

--

- And policing doesn't crack the Top 10 ["deadliest jobs"](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/01/28/charted-the-20-deadliest-jobs-in-america/) as measured by occupational fatality rates

--
  
  - Measured this way, *logging* and *fishing* are the most dangerous jobs
  
--

  - ***What are we missing when we measure danger this way?***

# How **Dangerous** is Policing?

--

- However, police account for 13% of workplace gun homicide victims, despite accounting for ~0.5% of the US workforce

--

- Gun homicide victimization rate for police is ~1.6x the U.S. rate

--

  - Nonfatal gun assault victimization disparity is even larger
  
--

- Determining how often officers *avert* injury or death is far more difficult

--

- According to [UCR data](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2019/crime-in-the-u.s.-2019/topic-pages/tables/table-29), in 2019 police made ~10 million arrests

--
  
  - Including ~500K arrests for violent offenses 
  - And ~150K arrests for weapons offenses (carrying, possessing, etc.)

# Evidence-Based Policing

--

In terms of *crime prevention*, policing is most effective when it is [**focused** and **proactive**](https://cebcp.org/evidence-based-policing/the-matrix/)

--

  - Must balance against potential for [police-caused harms](https://www.nap.edu/read/24928/chapter/1)
