# Pop Quiz!

--

Take out a sheet of paper and write down your answers to the following:

--

1. **In one sentence**, explain why we have police (i.e., what is their **purpose**?).

2. Do you believe the **violent crime rate** is higher, lower, or about the same as it was 3 years ago?

3. On any given day, about what % of their time do police spend **responding to violent crime**?

4. For every 1,000 crimes, how many do you think result in an **offender going to jail or prison**?

5. What gives Americans **confidence** in the police?

6. Is policing more dangerous, less dangerous, or about as dangerous as it was 30 years ago?

# The function of police in society

--

If we want to reform the police, [the first step](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/06/first-step-figuring-out-what-police-are/612793/) is figuring out what they're for.

--

- "*Fighting crime?*" "*Keeping the peace?*" "*Protecting and serving?*"

--

- Sociologist **Egon Bittner** famously said:

> [Police are nothing else than a mechanism for the distribution of situationally justified force in society.](https://www.ojp.gov/pdffiles1/Digitization/147822NCJRS.pdf)

--

- So we must ask ourselves: 

> [What kinds of situations require remedies that are non-negotiably coercible?](https://www.ojp.gov/pdffiles1/Digitization/147822NCJRS.pdf)

  - ***Do you agree?***

- Violent crime plays a small role in the day-to-day activities of police officers (< 2% of their time)

- Media makes a big deal out of homicides, but it's the smallest square on the graph

- A lot of policing is social work. Attempting to prevent general community harms, addressing disputes, otherwise assisting the public.

- Note these figures are from England & Wales where it's easier to generate national estimates

- **Only about half of all crimes are reported to the police**

- The detection rate in E&W at the time was 23% (so we're down to 99 of the original 1000 offenses)

- Of those, 60% resulted in an indictment, charge, or summons

- Conviction rate was nearly 83% (so now we're down to 50)

- Most of the punishments were fines, community service, suspended sentences...**only 8% of convictions result in jail or prison**

- **Why is this so important to see?** 

- **If you could improve any component of the funnel by 10%, where could you have the biggest impact?**

  - Even if we sentenced **everyone** found guilty to jail/prison, we'd still only be jailing offenders for 5% of all crimes
  
  - If **every** offender was forced to appear in court, it'd mean we'd be sending 39 more people to court
  
  - Police can do more to impact crime if they focus on the earlier components of the funnel. 
  
  - If we could generate a 10% increase in citizen willingness to call police for help, it'd mean police became aware of an additional 100 crimes, and this would have an impact on the rest of the funnel as well. 
  
  - So this begs the question: **How do we increase citizen willingness to call the police?**

- Public perception of the police is clearly driven by something other than crime/victimization

# How **Dangerous** is Policing?

--

- Line-of-duty deaths have declined dramatically [since the 1970s](https://doi.org/10.1111/1745-9133.12408)

--

- And policing doesn't crack the Top 10 ["deadliest jobs"](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/01/28/charted-the-20-deadliest-jobs-in-america/) as measured by occupational fatality rates

--
  
  - Measured this way, *logging* and *fishing* are the most dangerous jobs
  
--

  - ***What are we missing when we measure danger this way?***

# How **Dangerous** is Policing?

--

- However, police account for 13% of workplace gun homicide victims, despite accounting for ~0.5% of the US workforce

--

- Gun homicide victimization rate for police is ~1.6x the U.S. rate

--

  - Nonfatal gun assault victimization disparity is even larger
  
--

- Determining how often officers *avert* injury or death is far more difficult

--

- According to [UCR data](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2019/crime-in-the-u.s.-2019/topic-pages/tables/table-29), in 2019 police made ~10 million arrests

--
  
  - Including ~500K arrests for violent offenses 
  - And ~150K arrests for weapons offenses (carrying, possessing, etc.)

class: top

# Evidence-Based Policing

--

In terms of *crime prevention*, policing is most effective when it is *focused* and *proactive* (see [EBP Matrix](https://cebcp.org/evidence-based-policing/the-matrix/))

--

  - Must balance against potential for [police-caused harms](https://www.nap.edu/read/24928/chapter/1)

Black circles = effective
White circles = ineffective
Grey circles = mixed results
Red triangle = harmful intervention

- This figure tells us that interventions that focus **proactively** on **neighborhoods** or **individuals** are most effective in terms of crime reduction

- **Focus** on **people** and **places** that disproportionately conribute to community problems
