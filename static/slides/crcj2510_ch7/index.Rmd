**Survey research** involves the collection of information from a sample of individuals through their responses to questions. 
- Used by social scientists, journalists, political pundits, and marketing researchers
- It can be an efficient method for systematically collecting data from a broad spectrum of individuals and social settings

The US Census Bureau supplements its decennial census with more frequent surveys of the population to monitor income, economics, population mobility, etc. 

In 1973, the DOJ implemented the National Crime Surveys to better understand victimizations that don't get reported to police

They're attractive because they can be very **versatile**, **efficient**, and **generalizable**.

## Example of an *omnibus survey:*  [The GSS](https://gss.norc.org/)

???

Most surveys are directed at a specific research question or questions. An **omnibus survey** covers a range of topics of interest to different social scientists, and usually has multiple sponsors or is designed to generate data that would be useful to a broad segment of social science, rather than one specific RQ. 
- For example, the **General Social Survey**, administered by NORC
- Started in 1972 with funding from the NSF
- Today it is administered every 2 years as a 90-minute interview to a probability sample of ~3000 Americans
  - Includes >500 questions
- The drawback of an omnibus survey is the limited depth that can be obtained in any one area

Since 1990, the % of respondents answering "No" to this question has **QUADRUPLED**: from approximately 5% to nearly 20%
- Legally, officers are permitted to defend themselves from an assault. 
- This paper by Mourtgos and Adams discusses the tension between legal "reasonableness" and community standards of "reasonableness."

***What do you think might explain this trend?***
