# What Do We Know?

???

**Disclaimer**: I'm going to keep this conversation pretty high-level.

- Much of the work on this topic focuses on a single jurisdiction, or a small number of them
  - Which OTOH is great because policing predominantly takes place at the local level
  - But OTOH we can't be sure how well such findings generalize

(Thanks to [WAPO](https://github.com/washingtonpost/data-police-shootings), [Fatal Encounters](https://fatalencounters.org/), and [Mapping Police Violence](https://mappingpoliceviolence.squarespace.com/)!)

???

Reporting "justifiable homicides" to the FBI is voluntary. We always knew underreporting was likely an issue, but since 2014, we've come to learn that the FBI was under counting the true number by about 50%. 

Fortunately journalists and private citizens have stepped up and provided the data

But users beware! Each uses different inclusion criteria. Read their methodology before you go using them! I've reviewed multiple papers in the last year that saw key findings change after I pointed out the need to clean and/or consider the inclusion criteria.

## On average, police kill 3 people per day

--

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width = "95%"}
knitr::include_graphics("ois_per_day.png")
```

???

Each year, WAPO consistently tracks about 1,000 fatal police shootings (range ~950 to ~1050)

- Remarkable consistency
  - Over this period we've seen violence rise and fall
  - Debate about a "war on cops" and widespread de-policing after Ferguson and Floyd
  - A global pandemic
  - **And throughout it all, 3 people per day.**
  
  - The daily number of shootings bounces around between 0 and 9

- Nothing really jumps off the page here
  - No noticeable COVID or Floyd effect

## There are racial disparities in terms of who police kill

--

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width = "90%", fig.cap="Source: WAPO 2015-20"}
knitr::include_graphics("ois_by_race.png")
```

???

- Black people make up about 25% of police killings despite being just ~12% of the US population
- Black men face about a 1 in 1000 chance of being killed by police over the life course
- About 2.5x as likely as white men to be killed by police over the life course

## Police seem to kill at higher rates in the western US

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width = "90%", fig.cap= "Source: Schwartz & Jahn (2020)"}

```

???

This is from Gabe Schwartz and Jacquelyn Jahn in PLOS ONE. 
- They mapped police killings in all 382 MSAs from 2013 to 2017 using data from Fatal Encounters
- This map shows each MSA's rate, color coded by quintiles
- A clear pattern is visible here

## ...And racial disparities vary a lot by region, too

```

???

But check out how racial disparities differ by region. 
- This map shows the Black-white incidence rate ratios, again color coded by quintile
- All of the IRRs are >1, suggesting disparity.
- Black-white disparities way more pronounced in the Northeast

```

???

This one shows Latino-white IRRs
- Not all are >1 as in the Black-white IRRs
- And the largest disparity is 1.5 (whereas for Black-white it was 6.5)

Here, we see greater disparity in the southwest, Colorado, but also in some places in the northeast.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width = "90%", fig.cap="Source: WAPO 2015-21"}

```

???

Edwards et al: Lifetime risk for men is 1 in 2,000; for women its 1 in 33,000
- Women make up about 51% of the population, but just 5% of people killed by police.

## The average decedent is nearly 40

--

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width = "90%", fig.cap="Source: WAPO 2015-20"}
knitr::include_graphics("ois_by_age.png")
```

???

For young men between the ages of 25 and 29, police killings are a "leading cause of death" 
- 6th, behind accidents (including overdoses), suicides, homicides, heart disease, and cancer

But note that this distribution doesn't taper off until about age 40, whereas the "age-crime curve" tapers off quickly around age 25.

## Most decedents were armed and/or attacking officers

--

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width = "90%", fig.cap="Source: WAPO 2015-20"}
knitr::include_graphics("ois_by_weapon.png")
```

???

Almost 60% of those fatally shot were in possession of a firearm
- Another 35% had a knife, blunt object, or some other object
- And about 7% were unarmed

Of course a simple "armed/unarmed" dichotomy doesn't tell the whole story.

class: top

## Most decedents were armed and/or attacking officers

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width = "90%", fig.cap="Source: WAPO 2015-20"}
knitr::include_graphics("ois_by_threat.png")
```

???

WAPO also includes a field that indicates whether a person posed an **imminent threat**
- Imminent
  - firing a gun
  - attacking with a weapon other than a gun
  - pointing/brandishing a gun
- Other
  - brandishing a knife
  - refusing to drop a non-gun weapon
  - driving a vehicle at a person
  - moving quickly/lunging at an officer without a weapon
  - furtive movements
  - fleeing
  - accidental shootings
  
We could bicker over how some of these were coded. But a lot of them are pretty clear. In any event: these data suggest about 1 in 3 people fatally shot by police didn't pose an **imminent** threat.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width = "90%", fig.cap="Source: WAPO 2015-20"}
knitr::include_graphics("ois_by_weaponXthreat.png")
```

???

Now, look what happens when we cross-tab *weapon* and *threat*.
- 20% of those who had a gun apparently weren't pointing or shooting it.
- 52% of those with some other weapon apparently weren't attacking anyone with it.

On the flipside, note how 43% of those who were unarmed apparently still posed an imminent threat. Maybe going for the officer's gun, for example. 
- [One guy](https://www.tampabay.com/news/publicsafety/crime/hillsborough-state-attorney-clears-tampa-police-officer-in-18-year-olds/2262431/) was attempting to drown both an officer and his k9.
  - These sort of incidents are where BWCs can be very useful. Otherwise its the officer's word against the dead person's word.

## About 1 in 4 decedents display signs of mental illness

--

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width = "90%", fig.cap="Source: WAPO 2015-20"}
knitr::include_graphics("ois_by_mental_illness.png")
```

???

A lot has been made of the fact that 1 in 4 fatal shootings involved a person who displayed signs of mental illness. Here I've plotted the % of shootings where WAPO indicates the person had a mental illness each year, and there does appear to be an ever-so-slight downward trend. 

Two points are worth considering:
- [Lum et al. (2021)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/10986111211035002) recently analyzed millions of 911 calls to nine agencies and found that calls for mental health concerns made up about 1.3% of all calls on average. They conclude that getting police out of the business of responding to mental health crises won't do much to reduce the footprint of policing. Add to this how extremely rare fatal shootings are, and that 50% of the mentally ill decedents had a gun...and I'm not as optimistic that we'll see big reductions in these specific shootings any time soon. 

- I've also worked extensively with new "official" datasets (some of which I'll discuss momentarily), and they report a much lower percentage of shootings involve mentally ill persons. I suspect agencies use a more conservative definition than the news media, and that the truth might be somewhere in the middle.

# What We Need Know 🤔

## How often do police **use deadly force**?

> *The true frequency of police decisions to employ firearms as a means of deadly force...can best be determined by considering woundings and off-target shots as only fortuitous variations of fatal shootings. All are of a kind.* 

<div style="text-align: right"> - Jim Fyfe (1978) </div>

So our **best datasets** only provide us with a non-random sample of the outcome we seek to understand
